\begin{abstract}

Over the previous two centuries, optical microscopy has emerged as a viable tool for biological and medical research and diagnoses. Recently, the coded illumination microscope has emerged as a alternative to conventional optical systems, enabling many novel imaging techniques that are not possible with existing hardware such as quantitative phase imaging, motion deblur, and super-resolution imaging. This thesis introduces several novel coded-illumination techniques which enable phase retrieval, motion deblurring, and digital refocusing using combinations of software and hardware design. First, a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method using partially coherent color illumination is presented, enabling the synthesis of Zernike phase contrast and differential interference contrast images using a 3D-printed color filter and a color camera. This method is then further extended to motion deblurring of the linearized optical field, where we consider the imaging transfer functions in our choice of illumination pattern. Finally, a portable, smartphone-based coded-illumination microscope is presented which enables quantitative phase imaging and digital refocusing on a portable device, without the need for image post-processing on a PC. The common theme is a coded light source, which provides programmable digital contrast through the addition of a low-cost LED array.
