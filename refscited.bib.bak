	Abstract = {<p>Here we describe an ultra-low-cost origami-based approach for large-scale manufacturing of microscopes, specifically demonstrating brightfield, darkfield, and fluorescence microscopes. Merging principles of optical design with origami enables high-volume fabrication of microscopes from 2D media. Flexure mechanisms created via folding enable a flat compact design. Structural loops in folded paper provide kinematic constraints as a means for passive self-alignment. This light, rugged instrument can survive harsh field conditions while providing a diversity of imaging capabilities, thus serving wide-ranging applications for cost-effective, portable microscopes in science and education.</p>},

	Abstract = {We have previously shown that despite the presence of mRNA encoding CFTR, renal proximal cells do not exhibit cAMP-sensitive Cl(-) conductance (Rubera I, Tauc M, Bidet M, Poujeol C, Cuiller B, Watrin A, Touret N, Poujeol P. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 275: F651-F663, 1998). Nevertheless, in these cells, CFTR plays a crucial role in the control of the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) activated Cl(-) currents during hypotonic shock. The aim of this study was to determine the role of CFTR in the regulation of apoptosis volume decrease (AVD) and the apoptosis phenomenon. For this purpose, renal cells were immortalized from primary cultures of proximal convoluted tubules from cftr(+/+) and cftr(-/-) mice. Apoptosis was induced by staurosporine (STS; 1 microM). Cell volume, Cl(-) conductance, caspase-3 activity, intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutathione content (GSH/GSSG) were monitored during AVD. In cftr(+/+) cells, AVD and caspase-3 activation were strongly impaired by conventional Cl(-) channel blockers and by a specific CFTR inhibitor (CFTR(inh)-172; 5 microM). STS induced activation of CFTR conductance within 15 min, which was progressively replaced by VSOR Cl(-) currents after 60 min of exposure. In parallel, STS induced an increase in ROS content in the time course of VSOR Cl(-) current activation. This increase was impaired by CFTR(inh)-172 and was not observed in cftr(-/-) cells. Furthermore, the intracellular GSH/GSSG content decreased during STS exposure in cftr(+/+) cells only. In conclusion, CFTR could play a key role in the cascade of events leading to apoptosis. This role probably involves control of the intracellular ROS balance by some CFTR-dependent modulation of GSH concentration.},

@article{4016283,
	Abstract = {Suppose we are given a vector f in a class FsubeRopfN , e.g., a class of digital signals or digital images. How many linear measurements do we need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision epsi in the Euclidean (lscr2) metric? This paper shows that if the objects of interest are sparse in a fixed basis or compressible, then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small number of random measurements by solving a simple linear program. More precisely, suppose that the nth largest entry of the vector |f| (or of its coefficients in a fixed basis) obeys |f|(n)lesRmiddotn-1p/, where R>0 and p>0. Suppose that we take measurements yk=langf# ,Xkrang,k=1,...,K, where the Xk are N-dimensional Gaussian vectors with independent standard normal entries. Then for each f obeying the decay estimate above for some 0<p<1 and with overwhelming probability, our reconstruction ft, defined as the solution to the constraints yk=langf# ,Xkrang with minimal lscr1 norm, obeys parf-f#parlscr2lesCp middotRmiddot(K/logN)-r, r=1/p-1/2. There is a sense in which this result is optimal; it is generally impossible to obtain a higher accuracy from any set of K measurements whatsoever. The methodology extends to various other random measurement ensembles; for example, we show that similar results hold if one observes a few randomly sampled Fourier coefficients of f. In fact, the results are quite general and require only two hypotheses on the measurement ensemble which are detailed},

	Abstract = {We present novel techniques for analyzing the problem of low-rank matrix recovery. The methods are both considerably simpler and more general than previous approaches. It is shown that an unknown matrix of rank can be efficiently reconstructed from only randomly sampled expansion coefficients with respect to any given matrix basis. The number quantifies the #x201C;degree of incoherence #x201D; between the unknown matrix and the basis. Existing work concentrated mostly on the problem of #x201C;matrix completion #x201D; where one aims to recover a low-rank matrix from randomly selected matrix elements. Our result covers this situation as a special case. The proof consists of a series of relatively elementary steps, which stands in contrast to the highly involved methods previously employed to obtain comparable results. In cases where bounds had been known before, our estimates are slightly tighter. We discuss operator bases which are incoherent to all low-rank matrices simultaneously. For these bases, we show that randomly sampled expansion coefficients suffice to recover any low-rank matrix with high probability. The latter bound is tight up to multiplicative constants.},

@article{Alonso:11,
	Abstract = {This tutorial gives an overview of the use of the Wigner function as a tool for modeling optical field propagation. Particular emphasis is placed on the spatial propagation of stationary fields, as well as on the propagation of pulses through dispersive media. In the first case, the Wigner function gives a representation of the field that is similar to a radiance or weight distribution for all the rays in the system, since its arguments are both position and direction. In cases in which the field is paraxial and where the system is described by a simple linear relation in the ray regime, the Wigner function is constant under propagation along rays. An equivalent property holds for optical pulse propagation in dispersive media under analogous assumptions. Several properties and applications of the Wigner function in these contexts are discussed, as is its connection with other common phase-space distributions like the ambiguity function, the spectrogram, and the Husimi, P, Q, and Kirkwood--Rihaczek functions. Also discussed are modifications to the definition of the Wigner function that allow extending the property of conservation along paths to a wider range of problems, including nonparaxial field propagation and pulse propagation within general transparent dispersive media.},

We investigate the I-DT reconstruction problem assuming an incident (paraxial) spherical wave and scanning geometries that employ fixed source-to-object distances. Novel reconstruction methods are derived by identifying and exploiting tomographic symmetries and the rotational invariance of the problem. An underlying theme is that symmetries in tomographic imaging systems can facilitate solutions for phase-retrieval problems. A preliminary numerical investigation of the developed reconstruction methods is presented.},

	Abstract = {Decreases in the intracellular concentrations of both K(+) and Cl(-) have been implicated in playing a major role in the progression of apoptosis, but little is known about the temporal relationship between decreases in electrolyte concentration and the key events in apoptosis, and there is no information about how such decreases affect different intracellular compartments. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis was used to determine changes in element concentrations (Na, P, Cl, and K) in nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria in U937 cells undergoing UV-induced apoptosis. In all compartments, the initial stages of apoptosis were characterized by decreases in [K] and [Cl]. The largest decreases in these elements were in the mitochondria and occurred before the release of cytochrome c. Initial decreases in [K] and [Cl] also preceded apoptotic changes in the nucleus. In the later stages of apoptosis, the [K] continued to decrease, whereas that of Cl began to increase toward control levels and was accompanied by an increase in [Na]. In the nucleus, these increases coincided with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, chromatin condensation, and DNA laddering. The cytoplasm was the compartment least affected and the pattern of change of Cl was similar to those in other compartments, but the decrease in [K] was not significant until after active caspase-3 was detected. Our results support the concept that normotonic cell shrinkage occurs early in apoptosis, and demonstrate that changes in the intracellular concentrations of K and Cl precede apoptotic changes in the cell compartments studied.},

	Abstract = {We experimentally illustrate a lensfree holographic imaging platform to perform on-chip cytometry. By controlling the spatial coherence of the illumination source{,} we record a 2D holographic diffraction pattern of each cell or micro-particle on a chip using a high resolution sensor array that has [similar]2 [small micro]m pixel size. The recorded holographic image is then processed by using a custom developed decision algorithm for matching the detected hologram texture to existing library images for on-chip characterization and counting of a heterogeneous solution of interest. The holographic diffraction signature of any microscopic object is significantly different from the classical diffraction pattern of the same object. It improves the signal to noise ratio and the signature uniformity of the cell patterns; and also exhibits much better sensitivity for on-chip imaging of weakly scattering phase objects such as small bacteria or cells. We verify significantly improved performance of this holographic on-chip cytometry approach by automatically characterizing heterogeneous solutions of red blood cells{,} yeast cells{,} E. coli and various sized micro-particles without the use of any lenses or microscope objectives. This lensless on-chip holography platform will especially be useful for point-of-care cytometry and diagnostics applications involving e.g.{,} infectious diseases such as HIV or malaria.},

	Abstract = {Treatment with VP-16 (1-50 microM) or excess thymidine (5 mM) caused a block of L cells at different steps in their progression through the replicative cycle. The arrest was followed by an asynchronous process of cell death that conformed to criteria for apoptosis. Careful monitoring of this process in the whole cell population by flow cytometry showed a virtual absence of necrosis, an increase in side light scattering, followed by the occurrence of a population with subdiploid DNA fluorescence as well as reduced forward and side light scattering. The development of apoptosis required sufficient time and adequate ion gradients in the cells. By the combined use of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy data were obtained suggesting that (i) intracellular free Ca2+ and pH and/or their drug-induced alterations had to be adequately controlled for the apoptotic process to evolve; (ii) mitochondria were compromised earlier than the plasma membrane or lysosomes; and (iii) K+ extrusion possibly played a role in the final loss of cell volume. Interfering with the control of ion gradients and/or their changes in drug-treated cells resulted in cell death by necrosis.},

The different members of this class of uncertainty relations correspond to different choices of the quantity that measures the overall degree of coherence. One particular uncertainty relation has the property of being compatible with the ordinary uncertainty principle; the corresponding overall degree of coherence might therefore be considered the best possible choice of all the quantities that measure the overall degree of coherence of the light.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents a review of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) and of some of its applications to optical problems, especially in the field of partial coherence. The WDF describes a signal in space and in spatial frequency simultaneously and can be considered the local spatial-frequency spectrum of the signal. Although derived in terms of Fourier optics, the description of an optical signal by means of its WDF closely resembles the ray concept in geometrical optics; the WDF thus presents a link between partial coherence and radiometry. Properties of the WDF and its propagation through linear optical systems are considered; again, the description of systems by WDF's can be interpreted directly in geometric-optical terms. Some examples are included to show how the WDF can be applied to practical problems that arise in the field of partial coherence.},

@article{Beauvais1995,
	Abstract = {In the absence of appropriate stimulus, eosinophils in vitro rapidly exhibit the features of apoptotic cells (nuclear pycnosis, cell shrinkage, DNA fragmentation). By using electronic cell sizing, we precisely measured the volume distribution of human eosinophils during apoptosis. We observed that apoptosis of eosinophils was accompanied by a marked cell volume decrease (approximately 60\%). Moreover, analysis of the volume distribution in different experimental conditions (kinetics of apoptosis, inhibition of apoptosis by cytokines) revealed that the cell shrinkage, once triggered, was a fast process in which the intermediate states between normal and shrunken volume had a short half-life. As a model of apoptosis, the eosinophil model allowed us to test the hypothesis that apoptotic cell shrinkage was linked to osmotic changes due to leakage of internal ions. Indeed, in the presence of K+ channel blockers, the shrinkage was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results suggest that eosinophil shrinkage during apoptosis is a striking and rapid phenomenon and osmotic changes due to K+ efflux could be responsible, at least in part, of the volume decrease.},

	Abstract = {A method of tomographic phase retrieval is developed for multi-material objects whose components each has a distinct complex refractive index. The phase-retrieval algorithm, based on the Transport-of-Intensity equation, utilizes propagation-based X-ray phase contrast images acquired at a single defocus distance for each tomographic projection. The method requires a priori knowledge of the complex refractive index for each material present in the sample, together with the total projected thickness of the object at each orientation. The requirement of only a single defocus distance per projection simplifies the experimental setup and imposes no additional dose compared to conventional tomography. The algorithm was implemented using phase contrast data acquired at the SPring-8 Synchrotron facility in Japan. The three-dimensional (3D) complex refractive index distribution of a multi-material test object was quantitatively reconstructed using a single X-ray phase-contrast image per projection. The technique is robust in the presence of noise, compared to conventional absorption based tomography.},

	Abstract = {Fourier ptychography (FP) is a recently developed imaging approach that bypasses the resolution limit defined by the lens\&\#x2019; aperture. In current FP imaging platforms, systematic noise sources come from the intensity fluctuation of multiple LED elements and the pupil aberrations of the employed optics. These system uncertainties can significantly degrade the reconstruction quality and limit the achievable resolution, imposing a restriction on the effectiveness of the FP approach. In this paper, we report an optimization procedure that performs adaptive system correction for Fourier ptychographic imaging. Similar to the techniques used in phase retrieval, the reported procedure involves the evaluation of an image-quality metric at each iteration step, followed by the estimation of an improved system correction. This optimization process is repeated until the image-quality metric is maximized. As a demonstration, we used this process to correct for illumination intensity fluctuation, to compensate for pupil aberration of the optics, and to recover several unknown system parameters. The reported adaptive correction scheme may improve the robustness of Fourier ptychographic imaging by factoring out system imperfections and uncertainties.},

By using partially coherent illumination from a large aperture (~50 {\textmu}m), we acquire lower resolution lensfree in-line holograms of the objects with unit fringe magnification. For each lensfree hologram, the pixel size at the sensor chip limits the spatial resolution of the reconstructed image. To circumvent this limitation, we implement a sub-pixel shifting based super-resolution algorithm to effectively recover much higher resolution digital holograms of the objects, permitting sub-micron spatial resolution to be achieved across the entire sensor chip active area, which is also equivalent to the imaging field-of-view (24 mm2) due to unit magnification. We demonstrate the success of this pixel super-resolution approach by imaging patterned transparent substrates, blood smear samples, as well as Caenoharbditis Elegans.},

	Abstract = {Cell shrinkage is a major characteristic of apoptosis, but the mechanism and role of this process in cell death are poorly understood. The primary factor that controls volume regulation in all cells is ions, and thus we have examined the movement of ions at the single cell level in lymphocytes during apoptosis. Activation of the death program with several stimuli that act through independent pathways to stimulate apoptosis results in a synchronous shift of cells from a normal cell size to a shrunken cell size. Only the shrunken cells exhibit DNA fragmentation and an approximate 4-fold elevation of caspase-3-like activity. Analysis of K+ and Na+ ion content of individual cells by flow cytometry revealed that the intracellular ionic strength of apoptotic cells decreased substantially from their non-shrunken counterparts. Additionally, we show apoptosis is enhanced under conditions where the intracellular K+ concentration is diminished and that apoptosis is inhibited when K+ efflux is prevented. These data show that the efflux of ions, primarily potassium, plays a necessary and perhaps a pivotal role in the cell death program.},

	Abstract = {Cell shrinkage, or the loss of cell volume, is a ubiquitous characteristic of programmed cell death that is observed in all examples of apoptosis, independent of the death stimulus. This decrease in cell volume occurs in synchrony with other classical features of apoptosis. The molecular basis for cell shrinkage during apoptosis involves fluxes of intracellular ions including K+, Na+, and Cl-. Here we show for the first time that these ion fluxes, but not cell shrinkage, are necessary for apoptosis. Using sodium-substituted medium during anti-Fas treatment of Jurkat cells, we observed cellular swelling, a property normally associated with necrosis, in contrast to the typical cell shrinkage. Surprisingly, these swollen cells displayed all of the other classical features of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation, externalization of phosphatidylserine, caspase activity, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase cleavage, and internucleosomal DNA degradation. These swollen cells had a marked decrease in intracellular potassium, and subsequent inhibition of this potassium loss completely blocked apoptosis. Reintroduction of sodium ions in cell cultures reversed this cellular swelling, resulting in a dramatic loss of cell volume and the characteristic apoptotic morphology. Additionally, inhibition of sodium influx using a sodium channel blocker saxitoxin completely prevented the onset of anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. These findings suggest that sodium influx can control not only changes in cell size but also the activation of apoptosis, whereas potassium ion loss controls the progression of the cell death process. Therefore cell shrinkage can be separated from other features of apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {The loss of cell volume or cell shrinkage has been a morphological hallmark of the programmed cell death process known as apoptosis. This isotonic loss of cell volume has recently been term apoptotic volume decrease or AVD to distinguish it from inherent volume regulatory responses that occurs in cells under anisotonic conditions. Recent studies examining the intracellular signaling pathways that result in this unique cellular characteristic have determined that a fundamental movement of ions, particularly monovalent ions, underlie the AVD process and plays an important role on controlling the cell death process. An efflux of intracellular potassium was shown to be a critical aspect of the AVD process, as preventing this ion loss could protect cells from apoptosis. However, potassium plays a complex role as a loss of intracellular potassium has also been shown to be beneficial to the health of the cell. Additionally, the mechanisms that a cell employs to achieve this loss of intracellular potassium vary depending on the cell type and stimulus used to induce apoptosis, suggesting multiple ways exist to accomplish the same goal of AVD. Additionally, sodium and chloride have been shown to play a vital role during cell death in both the signaling and control of AVD in various apoptotic model systems. This review examines the relationship between this morphological change and intracellular monovalent ions during apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Cell shrinkage, or apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), is a ubiquitous characteristic of programmed cell death that is independent of the death stimulus and occurs in all examples of apoptosis. Here we distinguished two specific stages of AVD based on cell size and a unique early reversal of intracellular ions that occurs in response to activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic cell death signal pathways. The primary stage of AVD is characterized by an early exchange of the normal intracellular ion distribution for sodium from 12 to 113.6 mm and potassium from 139.5 to 30 mm. This early ionic reversal is associated with a 20-40\% decrease in cell volume, externalization of phosphatidylserine, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase activation and activity along with nuclear condensation that occurs independent of actin cytoskeleton disruption. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, however, prevents a secondary stage of AVD in apoptotic cells, characterized by a loss of both potassium and sodium that results in an 80-85\% loss in cell volume, DNA degradation, and apoptotic body formation. Together these studies demonstrate that AVD occurs in two distinct stages with the earliest stage reflecting a cellular cationic gradient reversal.},

	Abstract = {Phase-contrast x-ray computed tomography (CT) is an emerging imaging technique that can be implemented at third-generation synchrotron radiation sources or by using a microfocus x-ray source. Promising results have recently been obtained in materials science and medicine. At the same time, the lack of a mathematical theory comparable with that of conventional CT limits the progress in this field. Such a theory is now suggested, establishing a fundamental relation between the three-dimensional Radon transform of the object function and the two-dimensional Radon transform of the phase-contrast projection. A reconstruction algorithm is derived in the form of a filtered backprojection. The filter function is given in the space and spatial-frequency domains. The theory suggested enables one to quantitatively determine the refractive index of a weakly absorbing medium from x-ray intensity data measured in the near-field region. The results of computer simulations are discussed.},

For quantitative analysis of these images, the phase needs to be retrieved numerically. There are many phase-retrieval methods available. Those suitable for phase-contrast tomography, i.e., non-iterative phase-retrieval methods that use only one image at each projection angle, all follow the same pattern though derived in different ways. We outline this pattern and use it to compare the methods to each other, considering only phase-retrieval performance and not the additional effects of tomographic reconstruction. We also outline derivations, approximations and assumptions, and show which methods are similar or identical and how they relate to each other. A simple scheme for choosing reconstruction method is presented, and numerical phase-retrieval performed for all methods.},

	Abstract = {Partially coherent light provides attractive benefits in imaging, beam shaping, free-space communications, random medium monitoring, among other applications. However, the experimental characterization of the spatial coherence is a difficult problem involving second-order statistics represented by four-dimensional functions that cannot be directly measured and analyzed. In addition, real-world applications usually require quantitative characterization of the local spatial coherence of a beam in the absence of a priori information, together with fast acquisition and processing of the experimental data. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a technique that solves this problem. It comprises an optical setup developed for automatized video-rate measurement and a method \&\#x02013;phase-space tomographic coherenscopy\&\#x02013; allowing parallel data acquisition, processing, and analysis. This technique significantly simplifies the spatial coherence analysis and opens up new perspectives for the development of tools exploiting the degrees of freedom hidden into light coherence.},

	Abstract = {Suppose we wish to recover a signal x in C^n from m intensity measurements of the form |<x,z_i>|^2, i = 1, 2,..., m; that is, from data in which phase information is missing. We prove that if the vectors z_i are sampled independently and uniformly at random on the unit sphere, then the signal x can be recovered exactly (up to a global phase factor) by solving a convenient semidefinite program---a trace-norm minimization problem; this holds with large probability provided that m is on the order of n log n, and without any assumption about the signal whatsoever. This novel result demonstrates that in some instances, the combinatorial phase retrieval problem can be solved by convex programming techniques. Finally, we also prove that our methodology is robust vis a vis additive noise.},

	Abstract = {Phase retrieval is a technique for extracting quantitative phase information from X-ray propagation-based phase-contrast tomography (PPCT). In this paper, the performance of different single distance phase retrieval algorithms will be investigated. The algorithms are herein called phase-attenuation duality Born Algorithm (PAD-BA), phase-attenuation duality Rytov Algorithm (PAD-RA), phase-attenuation duality Modified Bronnikov Algorithm (PAD-MBA), phase-attenuation duality Paganin algorithm (PAD-PA) and phase-attenuation duality Wu Algorithm (PAD-WA), respectively. They are all based on phase-attenuation duality property and on weak absorption of the sample and they employ only a single distance PPCT data. In this paper, they are investigated via simulated noise-free PPCT data considering the fulfillment of PAD property and weakly absorbing conditions, and with experimental PPCT data of a mixture sample containing absorbing and weakly absorbing materials, and of a polymer sample considering different degrees of statistical and structural noise. The simulation shows all algorithms can quantitatively reconstruct the 3D refractive index of a quasi-homogeneous weakly absorbing object from noise-free PPCT data. When the weakly absorbing condition is violated, the PAD-RA and PAD-PA/WA obtain better result than PAD-BA and PAD-MBA that are shown in both simulation and mixture sample results. When considering the statistical noise, the contrast-to-noise ratio values decreases as the photon number is reduced. The structural noise study shows that the result is progressively corrupted by ring-like artifacts with the increase of structural noise (i.e. phantom thickness). The PAD-RA and PAD-PA/WA gain better density resolution than the PAD-BA and PAD-MBA in both statistical and structural noise study.},

	Abstract = {The video stream captured by an in-line holographic microscope can be analyzed on a frame-by-frame basis to track individual colloidal particles' three-dimensional motions with nanometer resolution, and simultaneously to measure their sizes and refractive indexes. Through a combination of hardware acceleration and software optimization, this analysis can be carried out in near real time with off-the-shelf instrumentation. An efficient particle identification algorithm automates initial position estimation with sufficient accuracy to enable unattended holographic tracking and characterization. This technique's resolution for particle size is fine enough to detect molecular-scale coatings on the surfaces of colloidal spheres, without requiring staining or fluorescent labeling. We demonstrate this approach to label-free holographic flow cytometry by detecting the binding of avidin to biotinylated polystyrene spheres.},

By tilting the barrier array, it is possible to distribute images for each viewing zone. Thus, the number of viewing zones can be increased with an increment of the states of the barrier array tilt.},

The actin-myosin system has been proposed to be the source of contractile force that drives bleb formation, although the biochemical pathway that promotes actin-myosin contractility during apoptosis has not been identified. Here we show that the Rho effector protein ROCK I, which contributes to phosphorylation of myosin light-chains, myosin ATPase activity and coupling of actin-myosin filaments to the plasma membrane, is cleaved during apoptosis to generate a truncated active form. The activity of ROCK proteins is both necessary and sufficient for formation of membrane blebs and for re-localization of fragmented DNA into blebs and apoptotic bodies.},

In this lensfree imaging technique, fluorescent samples placed on a chip are excited through a prism interface, where the pump light is filtered out by total internal reflection after exciting the entire sample volume. The emitted fluorescent light from the specimen is collected through an on-chip fiber-optic faceplate and is delivered to a wide field-of-view opto-electronic sensor array for lensless recording of fluorescent spots corresponding to the samples. A compressive sampling based optimization algorithm is then used to rapidly reconstruct the sparse distribution of fluorescent sources to achieve ~10 {\textmu}m spatial resolution over the entire active region of the sensor-array, i.e., over an imaging field-of-view of \&amp;gt;8 cm2. Such a wide-field lensless fluorescent imaging platform could especially be significant for high-throughput imaging cytometry, rare cell analysis, as well as for micro-array research.},

This is followed by cell fragmentation with the formation of sealed membrane vesicles, termed apoptotic bodies. In the present study we have demonstrated that the fungal metabolite cytochalasin B inhibits cell fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies, probably by its ability to interfere with actin polymerization. This effect was seen when HL-60 cells were pretreated with cytochalasin B and then exposed to one of a number of apoptosis-inducing agents, including UV irradiation, camptothecin, aphidocholin, or PMA plus ionomycin. The observed effect was not peculiar to HL-60 cells, inasmuch as it was also seen for both Molt-4 and U-937 cell lines. Cytochalasin B had no effect on DNA fragmentation occurring in the earliest stage of apoptosis, and it appeared to have no inhibitory effects on nuclear fragmentation. Staurosporin had an effect similar to that seen with cytochalasin B, probably due to its ability to inhibit protein kinase C, which is a known potentiator of microfilament assembly. These data demonstrate that microfilament assembly is necessary for the formation of apoptotic bodies in the later stages of the apoptotic process.},

By monitoring the tightly confined transmitted light spots through a circular aperture grid in a high Fresnel number regime, we can measure both intensity and phase front variations with a high sampling density (11 {\textmu}m) and high sensitivity (the sensitivity of normalized phase gradient measurement is 0.1 mrad under the typical working condition). By using WIS in a standard microscope, we can collect both bright-field (transmitted light intensity) and normalized phase gradient images. Our experiments further demonstrate that the normalized phase gradient images of polystyrene microspheres, unstained and stained starfish embryos, and strongly birefringent potato starch granules are improved versions of their corresponding differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope images in that they are artifact-free and quantitative. Besides phase microscopy, WIS can benefit machine recognition, object ranging, and texture assessment for a variety of applications.},

	Abstract = {We describe an active millimeter-wave holographic imaging system that uses compressive measurements for three-dimensional (3D) tomographic object estimation. Our system records a two-dimensional (2D) digitized Gabor hologram by translating a single pixel incoherent receiver. Two approaches for compressive measurement are undertaken: nonlinear inversion of a 2D Gabor hologram for 3D object estimation and nonlinear inversion of a randomly subsampled Gabor hologram for 3D object estimation. The object estimation algorithm minimizes a convex quadratic problem using total variation (TV) regularization for 3D object estimation. We compare object reconstructions using linear backpropagation and TV minimization, and we present simulated and experimental reconstructions from both compressive measurement strategies. In contrast with backpropagation, which estimates the 3D electromagnetic field, TV minimization estimates the 3D object that produces the field. Despite undersampling, range resolution is consistent with the extent of the 3D object band volume.},

	Abstract = {The refractive index (RI) of cellular material provides fundamental biophysical information about the composition and organizational structure of cells. Efforts to describe the refractive properties of cells have been significantly impeded by the experimental difficulties encountered in measuring viable cell RI. In this report we describe a procedure for the application of quantitative phase microscopy in conjunction with confocal microscopy to measure the RI of a cultured muscle cell specimen.The experimental strategy involved calculation of cell thickness by using confocal optical sectioning procedures, construction of a phase map of the same cell using quantitative phase microscopy, and selection of cellular regions of interest to solve for the cell RI.Mean cell thickness and phase values for six cell regions (five cytoplasmic and one nuclear) were determined. The average refractive index calculated for cytoplasmic and nuclear regions was 1.360 +/- 0.004. The uncertainty in the final RI value represents the technique measurement error.The methodology we describe for viable cell RI measurement with this prototype cell has broad generic application in the study of cell growth and functional responses. The RI value we report may be used in optical analyses of cultured cell structure and morphology.},

	Abstract = {The subcellular compartmentalization of ions is perturbed during the process of apoptosis. In this work, we investigated the impact of K+ on the apoptotic process in thymocytes and T cell hybridoma cells. Irrespective of the death-inducing stimulus (glucocorticoids, topoisomerase inhibition, or Fas-crosslinking), a significant K+ outflow was observed during apoptosis, as determined on the single-cell level by means of the K+-sensitive fluorochrome, benzofuran isophtalate. This loss of cytosolic K+ only occurs in cells that have completely disrupted their inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Inhibition of this mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss by Bcl-2 or by specific inhibitors acting on the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (bongkrekic acid, cyclosporin A) prevents K+ leakage. K+ drops at the same stage at which cells expose phosphatidylserine residues on the outer leaflet of the membrane and reduce the levels of nonoxidized glutathione, but before they hyperproduce reactive oxygen species, undergo massive Ca2+ influx, shrink, and lyse. In a cell-free system of apoptosis, isolated nuclei exposed to the supernatant of mitochondria that have undergone permeability transition only manifest chromatinolysis when the K+ concentration is lowered from physiologic to apoptotic levels. Accordingly, massive DNA fragmentation causing subdiploidy is confined to cells that have undergone K+ leakage. Together, these data point to the step-wise acquisition of membrane dysfunction in apoptosis and indicate an important role for the disruption of normal K+ homeostasis in apoptotic degradation. Derepression of endonucleases due to low K+ concentrations may be a decisive prerequisite for end-stage DNA fragmentation.},

	Abstract = {The critical scattering angle at 82.8-degrees from an air bubble in water locates the transition from transition to total reflection from elementary geometrical optics. The irradiance scattered into a narrow angular room near the critical scattering is a monotonically increasing function of bubble radius a provided a >> lambda and the weak contributions from rays reflected internally from the far side of the bubble are neglected. The asymptotic series for critical angle scattering derived here leads to a simple approximation for the irradiance. It also describes the breakdown of elementary geometrical optics for reflection at the critical angle from a curved surface. The leading correction to the scattering amplitude relative to the perfect reflection amplitude is found to be O(beta-1/4), where beta = 2-pi-a/lambda is the size parameter and lambda is the wavelength of light in water. The series is confirmed by comparison (as a function of beta) with smoothed Mie computations. The leading correction is significant for beta as large as 20,000, and it is larger when the light is polarized with the E field parallel to the scattering plane rather than perpendicular to it. The dependence on beta-1/4 is also shown from an average of the reflection coefficient over a Fresnel zone. Applications to optical bubble sizing are noted, and the nature of approximations in previous physical-optics models of critical angle scattering is clarified.},

	Abstract = {Inline digital holograms are classically reconstructed using linear operators to model diffraction. It has long been recognized that such reconstruction operators do not invert the hologram formation operator. Classical linear reconstructions yield images with artifacts such as distortions near the field-of-view boundaries or twin images. When objects located at different depths are reconstructed from a hologram, in-focus and out-of-focus images of all objects superimpose upon each other. Additional processing, such as maximum-of-focus detection, is thus unavoidable for any successful use of the reconstructed volume. In this Letter, we consider inverting the hologram formation model in a Bayesian framework. We suggest the use of a sparsity-promoting prior, verified in many inline holography applications, and present a simple iterative algorithm for 3D object reconstruction under sparsity and positivity constraints. Preliminary results with both simulated and experimental holograms are highly promising.},

	Abstract = {Sustained rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) and cell shrinkage mainly caused by K(+) and Cl(-) efflux are known to be prerequisites to apoptotic cell death. Here, we investigated how the efflux of K(+) and Cl(-) as well as the rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) occur prior to caspase activation and are coupled to each other in apoptotic human epithelial HeLa cells. Caspase-3 activation and DNA laddering induced by staurosporine were abolished by blockers of K(+) and Cl(-) channels or cytosolic Ca(2+) chelation. Staurosporine induced decreases in the intracellular free K(+) and Cl(-) concentrations ([K(+)](i) and [Cl(-)](i)) in an early stage prior to caspase-3 activation. Staurosporine also induced a long-lasting rise in the cytosolic free Ca(2+) concentration. The early-phase decreases in [K(+)](i) and [Cl(-)](i) were completely prevented by a blocker of K(+) or Cl(-) channel, but were not affected by cytosolic Ca(2+) chelation. By contrast, the Ca(2+) response was abolished by a blocker of K(+) or Cl(-) channel. Strong hypertonic stress promptly induced a cytosolic Ca(2+) increase lasting >50 min together with sustained shrinkage and thereafter caspase-3 activation after 4 h. The hypertonic stress induced slight increases in [K(+)](i) and [Cl(-)](i) in the first 50 min, but these increases were much less than the effect of shrinkage-induced condensation, indicating that K(+) and Cl(-) efflux took place. Hypertonicity induced caspase-3 activation that was prevented not only by cytosolic Ca(2+) chelation but also by K(+) and Cl(-) channel blockers. Thus, it is concluded that not only Ca(2+) mobilization but early-phase efflux of K(+) and Cl(-) are required for caspase activation, and Ca(2+) mobilization is a downstream and resultant event of cell shrinkage in both staurosporine- and hypertonicity-induced apoptosis.},

A similar depression of glutamate receptor responses was observed during LTD of synaptic transmission.

Our approach relies on the use of a digital optical condenser comprised of an array of light emitting diodes uniformly distributed inside of a hollow hemisphere. We demonstrate experimental observation of minimum feature sizes of the order of \&\#x03BB;/6 with the proposed technique. Although our experiments were performed at visible frequencies, we anticipate that the proposed approach to subwavelength resolution can be extended to the ultraviolet and infrared spectral regions.},

	Abstract = {The large consumer market has made cellphone lens modules available at low-cost and in high-quality. In a conventional cellphone camera, the lens module is used to demagnify the scene onto the image plane of the camera, where image sensor is located. In this work, we report a 3D-printed high-resolution Fourier ptychographic microscope, termed FPscope, which uses a cellphone lens in a reverse manner. In our platform, we replace the image sensor with sample specimens, and use the cellphone lens to project the magnified image to the detector. To supersede the diffraction limit of the lens module, we use an LED array to illuminate the sample from different incident angles and synthesize the acquired images using the Fourier ptychographic algorithm. As a demonstration, we use the reported platform to acquire high-resolution images of resolution target and biological specimens, with a maximum synthetic numerical aperture (NA) of 0.5. We also show that, the depth-of-focus of the reported platform is about 0.1 mm, orders of magnitude longer than that of a conventional microscope objective with a similar NA. The reported platform may enable healthcare accesses in low-resource settings. It can also be used to demonstrate the concept of computational optics for educational purposes.},

This system is the standard incoherent optical system modified by a phase mask with digital processing of the resulting intermediate image. The phase mask alters or codes the received incoherent wave front in such a way that the point-spread function and the optical transfer function do not change appreciably as a function of misfocus. Focus-independent digital filtering of the intermediate image is used to produce a combined optical--digital system that has a nearly diffraction limited point-spread function. This high-resolution extended depth of field is obtained through the expense of an increased dynamic range of the incoherent system. We use both the ambiguity function and the stationary-phase method to design these phase masks.},

@article{DuPre1978,
	Abstract = {Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were grown and maintained in continuous spinner culture. The population of dividing cells was synchronized by a double thymidine block technique. Cell cycle phases were determined graphically by plotting mitotic index, cell number, and DNA synthesis against time. Changes in the osmotic properties of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells during the cell cycle are described. Permeability to water is highest at the initiation of S and progressively decreases to its lowest value just after mitosis. Heats of activation for water permeability vary during the cell cycle, ranging from 9-14 kcal/mole. Results may imply changes in the state of water in the membrane during the cycle. The volume of osmotically active cell water is highest during S and early G2 and decreases during the mitotic phase, as cells undergo division. Total water content remains stable at 82\% (w/w) during the cycle. Total concentration of the three major ions (Na, K, Cl), expressed as mEq/liter total cell volume, does not change. The fraction of total cell water which is osmotically active (Ponder's R) decreased gradually from 0.75 at S to about 0.56 following mitosis. Findings suggest that a fraction of the total water within the cell exists in a "bound" form and is, therefore, incapable of being shifted under the driving force of osmotic pressure. This fraction of bound water increases during the cell cycle. Possible alterations in membrane fluidity and the state of water in the cell are discussed.},

@article{Eguchi1997,
	Abstract = {Although apoptosis and necrosis are morphologically distinct manifestations of cell death, apoptosis and some necroses share common features in the death signaling pathway involving functional steps of death-driving interleukin 1beta-converting enzyme family proteases and anti-cell death protein Bcl-2. One evident physiological difference in cells undergoing apoptosis versus necrosis is in intracellular levels of ATP. In this study, we specifically addressed the question of whether apoptosis depends on intracellular ATP levels, since longer incubation under ATP-depleting conditions results in necrotic cell death. Incubation of cells in glucose-free medium with an inhibitor of mitochondrial F0F1-ATPases reduces intracellular ATP levels and completely blocks Fas/Apo-1-stimulated apoptosis. ATP supplied through glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation restores the apoptotic cell death pathway. ATP depletion also leads to a block in Fas-induced activation of CPP32/Yama(-like) proteases, and when ATP is depleted after the activation of the proteases, subsequent apoptosis is significantly blocked. Thus, ATP-dependent steps exist both upstream and downstream of CPP32/Yama(-like) protease activation in apoptotic signal transduction. Treatment with the calcium ionophore induces apoptosis under ATP-supplying conditions but induces necrotic cell death under ATP-depleting conditions, indicating that ATP levels are a determinant of manifestation of cell death.},

	Abstract = {The process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is generally characterized by distinct morphological characteristics and energy-dependent biochemical mechanisms. Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is important in tissue maintenance. Hallmarks of apoptosis include caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and an overall reduction in cell volume. Whether this apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) is a mere response to initiators of apoptosis or whether it is functionally significant is not clear. In this study, we sought to answer this question using human malignant glioma cells as a model system. In vivo, high grade gliomas demonstrate an increased percentage of apoptotic cells as well as upregulation of death ligand receptors. By dynamically monitoring cell volume, we show that the induction of apoptosis, via activation of either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways with staurosporine or TRAIL, respectively, resulted in a rapid AVD in D54-MG human glioma cells. This decrease in cell volume could be prevented by inhibiting the efflux of Cl(-) through channels. Such suppression of AVD also reduced the activation of caspases 3, 8 and 9 and suppressed DNA fragmentation. Importantly, experimental manipulations that reduce the cell volume to 70\% of the original volume for periods of at least 3 hours were sufficient to initiate apoptosis even in the absence of death ligands. Hence, this data suggests that cell condensation is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {We present a method for direct non-optical quantification of dry mass, dry density and water mass of single living cells in suspension. Dry mass and dry density are obtained simultaneously by measuring a cell's buoyant mass sequentially in an H2O-based fluid and a D2O-based fluid. Rapid exchange of intracellular H2O for D2O renders the cell's water content neutrally buoyant in both measurements, and thus the paired measurements yield the mass and density of the cell's dry material alone. Utilizing this same property of rapid water exchange, we also demonstrate the quantification of intracellular water mass. In a population of E. coli, we paired these measurements to estimate the percent dry weight by mass and volume. We then focused on cellular dry density - the average density of all cellular biomolecules, weighted by their relative abundances. Given that densities vary across biomolecule types (RNA, DNA, protein), we investigated whether we could detect changes in biomolecular composition in bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. In E. coli, and S. cerevisiae, dry density increases from stationary to exponential phase, consistent with previously known increases in the RNA/protein ratio from up-regulated ribosome production. For mammalian cells, changes in growth conditions cause substantial shifts in dry density, suggesting concurrent changes in the protein, nucleic acid and lipid content of the cell.},

	Abstract = {On-axis digital holography (DH) is becoming widely used for its time-resolved three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities. A 3D volume can be reconstructed from a single hologram. DH is applied as a metrological tool in experimental mechanics, biology, and fluid dynamics, and therefore the estimation and the improvement of the resolution are current challenges. However, the resolution depends on experimental parameters such as the recording distance, the sensor definition, the pixel size, and also on the location of the object in the field of view. This paper derives resolution bounds in DH by using estimation theory. The single point resolution expresses the standard deviations on the estimation of the spatial coordinates of a point source from its hologram. Cram\'{e}r--Rao lower bounds give a lower limit for the resolution. The closed-form expressions of the Cram\'{e}r--Rao lower bounds are obtained for a point source located on and out of the optical axis. The influences of the 3D location of the source, the numerical aperture, and the signal-to-noise ratio are studied.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between cell volume (V(c)) and membrane potential (E(m)) in Rana temporaria striated muscle fibres was investigated under different conditions of intracellular acidification. Confocal microscope xz-scanning monitored the changes in V(c), whilst conventional KCl and pH-sensitive microelectrodes measured E(m) and intracellular pH (pH(i)), respectively. Applications of Ringer solutions with added NH(4)Cl induced rapid reductions in V(c) that rapidly reversed upon their withdrawal. These could be directly attributed to the related alterations in extracellular tonicity. However: (1) a slower and persistent decrease in V(c) followed the NH(4)Cl withdrawal, leaving V(c) up to 10\% below its resting value; (2) similar sustained decreases in resting V(c) were produced by the addition and subsequent withdrawal of extracellular solutions in which NaCl was isosmotically replaced with NH(4)Cl; (3) the same manoeuvres also produced a marked intracellular acidification, that depended upon the duration of the preceding exposure to NH(4)Cl, of up to 0.53 +/- 0.10 pH units; and (4) the corresponding reductions in V(c) similarly increased with this exposure time. These reductions in V(c) persisted and became more rapid with Cl(-) deprivation, thus excluding mechanisms involving either direct or indirect actions of pH(i) upon Cl(-)-dependent membrane transport. However they were abolished by the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain. The E(m) changes that accompanied the addition and withdrawal of NH(4)(+) conformed to a Nernst equation modified to include realistic NH(4)(+) permeability terms, and thus the withdrawal of NH(4)(+) restored E(m) to close to control values despite a persistent change in V(c). Finally these E(m) changes persisted and assumed faster kinetics with Cl(-) deprivation. The relative changes in V(c), E(m) and pH(i) were compared to predictions from the recent model of Fraser and Huang published in 2004 that related steady-state values of V(c) and E(m) to the mean charge valency (z(x)) of intracellular membrane-impermeant anions, X(-)(i). By assuming accepted values of intracellular buffering capacity (beta(i)), intracellular acidification was shown to produce quantitatively predictable decreases in V(c). These findings thus provide experimental evidence that titration of the anionic z(x) by increased intracellular [H(+)] causes cellular volume decrease in the presence of normal Na(+),K(+)- ATPase activity, with Cl(-)-dependent membrane fluxes only influencing the kinetics of such changes.},

@article{Fraser2007,
	Abstract = {The membrane potential (E(m)) is a fundamental cellular parameter that is primarily determined by the transmembrane permeabilities and concentration gradients of various ions. However, ion gradients are themselves profoundly influenced by E(m) due to its influence upon transmembrane ion fluxes and cell volume (V(c)). These interrelationships between E(m), V(c) and intracellular ion concentrations make computational modelling useful or necessary in order to guide experimentation and to achieve an integrated understanding of experimental data, particularly in complex, dynamic, multi-compartment systems such as skeletal and cardiac myocytes. A variety of quantitative techniques exist that may assist such understanding, from classical approaches such as the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium, to more recent "current-summing" models as exemplified by cardiac myocyte models including those of DiFrancesco & Noble, Luo & Rudy and Puglisi & Bers, or the "charge-difference" modelling technique of Fraser & Huang so far applied to skeletal muscle. In general, the classical approaches provide useful and important insights into the relationships between E(m), V(c) and intracellular ion concentrations at steady state, providing their core assumptions are fully understood, while the more recent techniques permit the modelling of changing values of E(m), V(c) and intracellular ion concentrations. The present work therefore reviews the various approaches that may be used to calculate E(m), V(c) and intracellular ion concentrations with the aim of establishing the requirements for an integrated model that can both simulate dynamic systems and recapitulate the key findings of classical techniques regarding the cellular steady state. At a time when the number of cellular models is increasing at an unprecedented rate, it is hoped that this article will provide a useful and critical analysis of the mathematical techniques fundamental to each of them.},

	Abstract = {Refractive index dispersion is an intrinsic optical property and a useful source of contrast in biological imaging studies. In this report, we present the first dispersion phase imaging of living eukaryotic cells. We have developed quantitative dispersion microscopy based on the principle of quantitative phase microscopy. The dual-wavelength quantitative phase microscope makes phase measurements at 310 nm and 400 nm wavelengths to quantify dispersion (refractive index increment ratio) of live cells. The measured dispersion of living HeLa cells is found to be around 1.088, which agrees well with that measured directly for protein solutions using total internal reflection. This technique, together with the dry mass and morphology measurements provided by quantitative phase microscopy, could prove to be a useful tool for distinguishing different types of biomaterials and studying spatial inhomogeneities of biological samples.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a single-shot spectral imaging approach based on the concept of compressive sensing. The primary features of the system design are two dispersive elements, arranged in opposition and surrounding a binary-valued aperture code. In contrast to thin-film approaches to spectral filtering, this structure results in easily-controllable, spatially-varying, spectral filter functions with narrow features. Measurement of the input scene through these filters is equivalent to projective measurement in the spectral domain, and hence can be treated with the compressive sensing frameworks recently developed by a number of groups. We present a reconstruction framework and demonstrate its application to experimental data.},

	Abstract = {Bcl-2 overexpression in transfected PW cells is associated with inhibition of radiation-induced programmed cell death (PCD). We have previously reported that there is a relationship between inhibition of radiation-induced PCD and membrane hyperpolarization in these cells. In this article, we report that Na+/ K(+)-ATPase pump activity, as measured by the uptake of Rubidium-86 (86Rb+), is significantly higher in Bcl-2 overexpressing PW cells than in control PW cells, and that pump activity following irradiation with doses > or = 500 cGy was reduced to a lesser extent in the Bcl-2 transfectants than in the control cells. When PW-Bcl-2 cells were incubated with a dose of ouabain (1 microM) that decreased pump activity significantly, but did not induce PCD, the previously reported protection from radiation-induced PCD associated with overexpression of Bcl-2 no longer existed. In order to demonstrate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) affected Na+/ K(+)-ATPase pump activity, cells were incubated with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) prior to irradiation, or treated with the ROS generating drug buthionine sulphoxamine (BSO). 86Rb+ uptake was significantly higher in irradiated cells incubated with NAC compared to cells irradiated in the absence of NAC, while BSO resulted in lower levels of 86Rb+ uptake, suggesting that the effects of radiation on the Na+/K(+)-ATPase pump were due to ROS. Furthermore, the resting cell membrane potential of cells exposed to NAC were slightly hyperpolarized compared to control PW cells, whereas cells exposed to BSO were depolarized in comparison to control PW cells. In summary, this data suggests that Bcl-2 affects Na+/K(+)-ATPase pump activity, which is associated with the resting membrane potential and the level of susceptibility to radiation-induced PCD.},

	Abstract = {Osmotic permeability characteristics and the effects of cryoprotectants are important determinants of recovery and function of spermatozoa after cryopreservation. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the osmotic permeability parameters of human spermatozoa in the presence of cryoprotectants. A series of experiments was done to: 1) validate the use of an electronic particle counter for determining both static and kinetic changes in sperm cell volume; 2) determine the permeability of the cells to various cryoprotectants; and 3) test the hypothesis that human sperm water permeability is affected by the presence of cryoprotectant solutes. The isosmotic volume of human sperm was 28.2 +/- 0.2 microns3 (mean +/- SEM), 29.0 +/- 0.3 microns3, and 28.2 +/- 0.4 microns3 at 22, 11, and 0 degrees C, respectively, measured at 285 mOsm/kg via an electronic particle counter. The osmotically inactive fraction of human sperm was determined from Boyle van't Hoff (BVH) plots of samples exposed to four different osmolalities (900, 600, 285, and 145 mOsm/kg). Over this range, cells behaved as linear osmometers with osmotically inactive cell percentages at 22, 11, and 0 degrees C of 50 +/- 1\%, 41 +/- 2\%, and 52 +/- 3\%, respectively. Permeability of human sperm to water was determined from the kinetics of volume change in a hyposmotic solution (145 mOsm/kg) at the three experimental temperatures. The hydraulic conductivity (Lp) was 1.84 +/- 0.06 microns.min-1.atm-1, 1.45 +/- 0.04 microns.min-1.atm-1, and 1.14 +/- 0.07 microns.min-1.atm-1 at 22, 11, and 0 degrees C, respectively, yielding an Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) of 3.48 kcal/mol. These biophysical characteristics of human spermatozoa are consistent with findings in previous reports, validating the use of an electronic particle counter for determining osmotic permeability parameters of human sperm. This validated system was then used to investigate the permeability of human sperm to four different cryoprotectant solutes, i.e., glycerol (Gly), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol (PG), and ethylene glycol (EG), and their effects on water permeability. A preloaded, osmotically equilibrated cell suspension was returned to an isosmotic medium while cell volume was measured over time. A Kedem-Katchalsky model was used to determine the permeability of the cells to each solute and the resulting water permeability. The permeabilities of human sperm at 22 degrees C to Gly, DMSO, PG, and EG were 2.07 +/- 0.13 x 10(-3) cm/min, 0.80 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) cm/min, 2.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) cm/min, and 7.94 +/- 0.67 x 10(-3) cm/min, respectively. The resulting Lp values at 22 degrees C were reduced to 0.77 +/- 0.08 micron.min-1.atm-1, 0.84 +/- 0.07 micron.min-1.atm-1, 1.23 +/- 0.09 microns.min-1.atm-1, and 0.74 +/- 0.06 micron.min-1.atm-1, respectively. These data support the hypothesis that low-molecular-weight, nonionic cryoprotectant solutes affect (decrease) human sperm water permeability.},

	Abstract = {Ptychography is a coherent imaging technique that enables an image of a specimen to be generated from a set of diffraction patterns. One limitation of the technique is the assumption of a multiplicative interaction between the illuminating coherent beam and the specimen, which restricts ptychography to samples no thicker than a few tens of micrometers in the case of visible-light imaging at micron-scale resolution. By splitting a sample into axial sections, we demonstrated in recent work that this thickness restriction can be relaxed and whats-more, that coarse optical sectioning can be realized using a single ptychographic data set. Here we apply our technique to data collected from a modified optical microscope to realize a reduction in the optical sectioning depth to 2 $\mu$m in the axial direction for samples up to 150 $\mu$m thick. Furthermore, we increase the number of sections that are imaged from 5 in our previous work to 34 here. Our results compare well with sectioned images collected from a confocal microscope but have the added advantage of strong phase contrast, which removes the need for sample staining.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis is a physiological form of death in which cells turn-on an intrinsic genetic program that eventually leads to their destruction in a highly regulated manner. This process renders elimination of "unwanted cells" in the body, and accounts for cellular turnover and homeostasis of tissues in multicellular organisms. Consequently, an imbalance in the apoptotic rate in a particular tissue can lead to profound effects in the whole organism. Exposure of cells to apoptotic stimuli induces a rapid loss of cell volume (apoptotic volume decrease) that plays a pivotal role in the decision of a cell to undergo apoptosis. Interestingly, the apoptotic volume decrease is driven by changes in ionic fluxes across the plasma membrane that promote a decrease in the intracellular ions that ultimately also leads to a reduction in intracellular ionic strength. Despite an intensive research effort however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that trigger changes in cell volume during apoptosis remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, this apoptotic volume decrease has been shown to be a necessary component of the apoptotic cascade and an important point of modulation for the entire cell death process. In this review, we will focus on the importance of the apoptotic volume decrease in the context of signaling and modulation of programmed cell death.},

	Abstract = {Spatial coherence in optical processing can be exploited to implement a wide variety of image processing functions. While fully coherent systems tend to receive the most attention, spatially noncoherent systems can often provide equivalent functionality while offering significant advantages over coherent systems with regard to noise performance and system robustness. The term noncoherent includes both partially coherent and fully incoherent illumination. In addition to the noise immunity advantage, noncoherent diffraction-based processors have relaxed requirements on pupil plane spatial light modulator characteristics. In this paper we provide a discussion of the tradeoffs between coherent and noncoherent processing, taking into account the limited performance characteristics of commercially available spatial light modulators. The advantages of noncoherent processing are illustrated with numerical and experimental results corresponding to three different noncoherent architectures.},

	Abstract = {Cell volume is one of the basic characteristics of a cell and is being extensively studied in relationship to a variety of processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, fertility, or locomotion. At the same time, its measurement under a microscope has not been well developed. The method we propose uses negative transmission contrast rendered to cells by a strongly absorbing dye present in the extracellular medium. Cells are placed in a shallow compartment, and a nontoxic and cell-impermeant dye, such as acid blue 9, is added to the medium. Transmission images are collected at the wavelength of maximum dye absorption (630?nm). Where the cell body displaces the dye, the thickness of the absorbing layer is reduced; thus, an increase in cell thickness produces brighter images and vice versa. The absolute values for cell thickness and volume can be easily extracted from the image by computing the logarithm of intensity and dividing it by the absorption coefficient. The method is fast, impervious to instability of the light source, and has a high signal-to-noise ratio; it can be realized either on a laser scanning or a conventional microscope equipped with a bandpass filter. For long-term experiments, we use a Bioptechs perfusion chamber fitted with a 0.03-mm spacer and an additional port to enable rapid switching of solutions. To show possible applications of this method, we investigated the kinetics of the cell volume response to a hypotonic buffer and to the apoptotic agents staurosporine and ionomycin.},

The quality of thereconstruction is largely sufficient for optimal segmentation and furtherpostprocessing even though the filter correction is based on assumption ofconstant absorption.

By applying the stationary-phase formula to the Fresnel integral, we derive a new variant of the transport of intensity equation (TIE) that explicitly takes image magnification into account and does not require the distance between the two observation planes to be infinitesimally small. The new derivation method provides a uniform technique for obtaining the TIE's with incident waves of different types and also leads to new practically convenient validity conditions. A new boundary problem for the TIE, which is particularly suitable for the in-line imaging, is defined and solved analytically. Numerical examples of phase retrieval using simulated data in the in-line case with a point source are also given. The present approach should be useful in quantitative phase-contrast microscopy and tomography using microfocus sources. The question of partial coherence is briefly discussed but is essentially outside the scope of the present work.},

@article{Hasegawa2012,
	Abstract = {Persistent cell shrinkage, called apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), is a pivotal event of apoptosis. Activation of the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying Cl(-) channel (VSOR) is involved in the AVD induction. On the other hand, activation of the MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade is also known to play a critical role in apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the AVD induction and the stress-responsive MAPK cascade activation during the apoptosis process induced by staurosporine (STS) in HeLa cells. STS was found to induce AVD within 2-5 min and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK after over 20-30 min. VSOR blockers suppressed not only STS-induced AVD but also phosphorylation of JNK and p38 as well as activation of caspase-3/7. Moreover, a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, failed to affect STS-induced AVD, whereas these compounds reduced STS-induced activation of caspase-3/7. Also, treatment with ASK1-specific siRNA suppressed STS-induced caspase-3/7 activation without affecting the AVD induction. Furthermore, sustained osmotic cell shrinkage per se was found to trigger phosphorylation of JNK and p38, caspase activation, and cell death. Thus, it is suggested that activation of p38 and JNK is a downstream event of AVD for the STS-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells.},

Methods used were phenomenological and included assessments of the volumes of osmotically active water, content of K+, Na+, and Cl-, volumes of distribution for Na+, urea, and ethylene glycol, and the thermodynamics of transport of water and solutes into and out of the cell. The erythroblastic leukemic cell provided evidence for compartments of osmotically active and inactive water and solute. The synchronized ascites tumor cell indicated that these compartments varied during the cell cycle. Membrane function as defined by its permeability to water also varied during the cell cycle. When proliferating cells matured, changes in membrane permeability to water and to nonelectrolytes also correlated with successive stages of differentiation.},

@article{Hessler2005,
	Abstract = {Apoptosis is defined by a distinct set of morphological changes observed during cell death including loss of focal adhesions, the formation of cell membrane buds or blebs, and a decrease in total cell volume. Recent studies suggest that these dramatic morphological changes, particularly apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), are an early prerequisite to apoptosis and precede key biochemical time-points. Here we use atomic force microscopy to observe early stage AVD of KB cells undergoing staurosporine-induced apoptosis. After a 3-h exposure to 1 microM staurosporine, a 32\% decrease in total cell height and a 50\% loss of total cell volume is observed accompanied by only a 15\% change in cell diameter. The observed AVD precedes key biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis such as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, phosphatidyl serine translocation, nuclear fragmentation, and measurable caspase-3 activity. This suggests that morphological volume changes occur very early in the induction of apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {As metrology tolerances for photomasks become increasingly tight, the issues of measurement methods and calibration standards become more and more important. This is as true for optical phase metrology as it is for dimensional metrology. To first order, an optical phase standard can be defined by etching a step or trench into a transparent medium like fused silica with a well-characterized index of refraction. The normal-incidence phase shift of such a structure can be calculated with accuracy limited mainly by our ability to measure the physical depth of the trench. Other methods exist for measuring optical phase shifts in alternating aperture masks. For example a Levenson grating exhibits symmetrical behavior through focus only if the phase difference between the phase shifted and unshifted openings is exactly 180$\,^{\circ}$. A measured asymmetry between the phase shifted and unshifted clear features in such a grating can be used to quantitatively measure the deviation from 180$\,^{\circ}$ optical phase. This approach is particularly attractive because the measurement can be made on an aerial image metrology system with the numerical aperture and illumination conditions used by the wafer stepper that will eventually project the mask. Calibration of optical phase in attenuating phase masks is more difficult. Until now there has been no accurate way to create and verify a calibration artifact. In this paper we discuss a new phase metrology pattern for attenuating phase masks. The phase error of this pattern can be determined to high accuracy by aerial image measurements. This pattern can be used to create an optical phase standard for calibrating phase metrology equipment for attenuated phase masks, or as a witness pattern on a product mask to verify the phase accuracy of that mask.},

Following the first theoretical treatment of the technique,we present images of a microchip target derived from an annular syntheticaperture (NA $=$ 0.61) whose area is 15 times that due to a single hologram(NA $=$ 0.13); they exhibit a corresponding qualitative improvement. Wedemonstrate that a high-quality reconstruction may be obtained from alimited sub-region of Fourier space, if the object's structural information isconcentrated there.},

	Abstract = {The ability to control cell volume is fundamental for proper cell function. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding of the complex sequences of events by which acute cell volume perturbation alters the activity of osmolyte transport proteins in cells from vertebrate organisms. After cell swelling, the main effectors in the process of regulatory volume decrease are swelling-activated K(+) and Cl(-) channels, a taurine efflux pathway, and KCl cotransport. After cell shrinkage, the main effectors in the process of regulatory volume increase are Na(+)/H(+) exchange, Na(+), K(+), 2Cl(-) cotransport, and in some cells, shrinkageactivated Na(+) channels. All of these proteins are regulated in a unique manner by cell volume perturbations. The molecular identity of most, although not all, of these transport pathways is now known. Among other important advances, this has lead to the identification of transporter binding partners such as protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements and lipids. Considerable progress has also been made recently in understanding the upstream elements in volume sensing and volume-sensitive signal transduction, and salient features of these systems will be discussed. In contrast to the simple pathway of osmosensing in yeast, cells from vertebrate organisms appear to exhibit multiple volume sensing systems, the specific mechanism(s) activated being cell type- and stimulus-dependent. Candidate sensors include integrins and growth factor receptors, while other early events include regulation of Rho family GTP binding proteins, Ste20-related protein kinases, and phospholipases, as well as cytoskeletal reorganization, Transient Receptor Potential channel-mediated Ca(2+) influx, and generation of reactive oxygen species.},

	Abstract = {This review focuses on using the knowledge on volume-sensitive transport systems in Ehrlich ascites tumour cells and NIH-3T3 cells to elucidate osmotic regulation of salt transport in epithelia. Using the intestine of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) (an absorptive epithelium of the type described in the renal cortex thick ascending limb (cTAL)) we have focused on the role of swelling-activated K+- and anion-conductive pathways in response to hypotonicity, and on the role of the apical (luminal) Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2) in the response to hypertonicity. The shrinkage-induced activation of NKCC2 involves an interaction between the cytoskeleton and protein phosphorylation events via PKC and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) opercular epithelium is a Cl(-)-secreting epithelium of the type described in exocrine glands, having a CFTR channel on the apical side and the Na+/K+ ATPase, NKCC1 and a K+ channel on the basolateral side. Osmotic control of Cl- secretion across the operculum epithelium includes: (i) hyperosmotic shrinkage activation of NKCC1 via PKC, MLCK, p38, OSR1 and SPAK; (ii) deactivation of NKCC by hypotonic cell swelling and a protein phosphatase, and (iii) a protein tyrosine kinase acting on the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to set levels of NKCC activity.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis occurs through a sequence of specific biochemical and morphological alterations that define the progress of cell death. The changes of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, the apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and the activation of caspases have been measured in RAW 264.7, HeLa and Jurkat T cells incubated with molecules that induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Our data show that NO, staurosporine, etoposide and camptothecin increased DeltaPsi(m) in macrophages but not in HeLa and Jurkat cells, that exhibited a DeltaPsi(m) decrease. Moreover, the apoptosis induced by NO in macrophages, but not that promoted by staurosporine, might occur in the absence of AVD. Analysis of the sequence of apoptotic manifestations shows that DeltaPsi(m) precedes AVD and caspase activation in RAW 264.7 cells. Inhibition of AVD abrogates apoptosis in HeLa and Jurkat T cells regardless of the stimuli used. These data suggest that the changes of DeltaPsi(m) are cell-type dependent and that AVD is dispensable for apoptosis in macrophages.},

	Abstract = {{Bubble characteristics are very important in the design of fluidized beds because they govern hydrodynamics and efficiency of the operation for which the bed is used. In this work, a digital image analysis technique has been developed to study the fluidization dynamics of a lab-scale two-dimensional bubbling bed. Digital image analysis may supply a great quantity of information; it is non-intrusive, capable of securing several properties simultaneously and cost effective. The image analysis method here developed allows for the simultaneous measurements of various significant bubble properties, i.e. bubble size and bubble velocity distributions, bed height and bubble-phase hold-up, by means of a purposely in-house developed software. Present results were compared with relevant literature correlations and resulted in sound agreement, thus confirming the large potential of the technique here developed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Under certain conditions both the spatial and spectral details of the radiative object can be recovered simultaneously from the three-dimensional spatial coherence function in the diffraction region. The recovery of object information is based on a Fourier-transform relationship derived from the basic formula \[E. Wolf and W. H. Carter, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 68, 953--964 (1978)\] describing the field correlation function in terms of the source correlation function. A new type of interferometer is proposed for the efficient collection of the spatial coherence data. Experimental results of the spectral-image recovery are also presented.},

	Abstract = {Equations have been written and solved that describe for animal cells the relationships among membrane transport, cell volume, membrane potential, and distribution of permeant solute. The essential system consists of n + 2 equations, where n is the number of permeant solute species. The n of the equations are the n transport equations for the permeant species, one for each species. The other two equations are statements of 1) the condition for bulk electroneutrality inside the cell and 2) the condition for isotonicity between the interior and exterior of the cell. Numerical solutions have been obtained in both the steady-state and time-varying cases for transport equations that are physically and phenomenologically reasonable. In addition to numerical solutions analytic expressions are presented that show the ranges of membrane parameters essential for volume regulation; for values of membrane parameters beyond explicitly defined bounds, the equations do not have real, positive solutions for cell volume.},

	Abstract = {A novel quantitative phase imaging method is shown to estimate phase accurately over a wide range of length scales using K\&\#xF6;hler illumination from an extended incoherent source. The method is based on estimating the longitudinal intensity derivative in the transport-of-intensity equation via convolution with multiple Savitzky\&\#x2013;Golay differentiation filters and generalizes methods previously developed for coherent imaging to the practical scenario of partially coherent imaging. The resulting noise and resolution performance are evaluated via numerical simulation and demonstrated experimentally using a blazed transmission grating as well as a single-mode fiber as test objects.},

We first transform the wave propagation equation and nonlinear observation model (intensity measurement) into a complex augmented state space model. From the state space model, we derive a sparse augmented complex extended Kalman filter (ACEKF) to infer the complex optical field (amplitude and phase), and find that it converges under mild conditions. Our proposed method has a computational complexity of NzN logN and storage requirement of \&\#x1D4AA;(N), compared with the original ACEKF method, which has a computational complexity of \&\#x1D4AA;(NzN3) and storage requirement of \&\#x1D4AA;(N2), where Nz is the number of images and N is the number of pixels in each image. Thus, it is efficient, robust and recursive, and may be feasible for real-time phase recovery applications with high resolution images.},

	Abstract = {We propose an alternative method for solving the Transport of Intensity equation (TIE) from a stack of through\&\#x02013;focus intensity images taken by a microscope or lensless imager. Our method enables quantitative phase and amplitude imaging with improved accuracy and reduced data capture, while also being computationally efficient and robust to noise. We use prior knowledge of how intensity varies with propagation in the spatial frequency domain in order to constrain a fitting algorithm \&\#x0005B;Gaussian process (GP) regression\&\#x0005D; for estimating the axial intensity derivative. Solving the problem in the frequency domain inspires an efficient measurement scheme which captures images at exponentially spaced focal steps, significantly reducing the number of images required. Low\&\#x02013;frequency artifacts that plague traditional TIE methods can be suppressed without an excessive number of captured images. We validate our technique experimentally by recovering the phase of human cheek cells in a brightfield microscope.},

	Abstract = {A new method to measure intracellular volume in Dunaliella was developed, where lithium ions are used as monitors of the extracellular volume. Li(+) is shown to be impenetrable to the intracellular volume, insignificantly absorbed to the algae, and is rapidly and evenly distributed within the extracellular volume. The method is suggested to be free of several limitations and consistent errors present in several previously employed techniques.Using the new technique it is shown that both Dunaliella salina and Dunaliella bardawil adjust to a constant cellular volume when grown in a medium containing salt concentrations ranging from 0.5 molar to 4 molar NaCl. That volume is 90 femtoliter per cell for D. salina and 600 femtoliter per cell for D. bardawil. Nonosmotic volume accounts for about 10\% of the total cell volume.The intracellular sodium concentration, as determined with the new technique, was under all experimental conditions tested below 100 millimolar. This was true both for cells grown on 0.5 to 4 molar NaCl, and during the osmoregulatory process. It is thus concluded that intracellular NaCl is a minor contributor to the overall intracellular osmotic pressure in Dunaliella.},

	Abstract = {We examine some fundamental theoretical limits on the ability of practical digital holography (DH) systems to resolve detail in an image. Unlike conventional diffraction-limited imaging systems, where a projected image of the limiting aperture is used to define the system performance, there are at least three major effects that determine the performance of a DH system: (i) The spacing between adjacent pixels on the CCD, (ii) an averaging effect introduced by the finite size of these pixels, and (iii) the finite extent of the camera face itself. Using a theoretical model, we define a single expression that accounts for all these physical effects. With this model, we explore several different DH recording techniques: off-axis and inline, considering both the dc terms, as well as the real and twin images that are features of the holographic recording process. Our analysis shows that the imaging operation is shift variant and we demonstrate this using a simple example. We examine how our theoretical model can be used to optimize CCD design for lensless DH capture. We present a series of experimental results to confirm the validity of our theoretical model, demonstrating recovery of super-Nyquist frequencies for the first time.},

	Abstract = {Amiloride inhibits most plasma membrane Na+ transport systems. We have reviewed the pharmacology of inhibition of these transporters by amiloride and its analogs. Thorough studies of the Na+ channel, the Na+/H+ exchanger, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, clearly show that appropriate modification of the structure of amiloride will generate analogs with increased affinity and specificity for a particular transport system. Introduction of hydrophobic substituents on the terminal nitrogen of the guanidino moiety enhances activity against the Na+ channel; whereas addition of hydrophobic (or hydrophilic) groups on the 5-amino moiety enhances activity against the Na+/H+ exchanger. Activity against the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and Ca2+ channel is increased with hydrophobic substituents at either of these sites. Appropriate modification of amiloride has produced analogs that are several hundred-fold more active than amiloride against specific transporters. The availability of radioactive and photoactive amiloride analogs, anti-amiloride antibodies, and analogs coupled to support matrices should prove useful in future studies of amiloride-sensitive transport systems. The use of amiloride and its analogs in the study of ion transport requires a knowledge of the pharmacology of inhibition of transport proteins, as well as effects on enzymes, receptors, and other cellular processes, such as DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and cellular metabolism. One must consider whether the effects seen on various cellular processes are direct or due to a cascade of events triggered by an effect on an ion transport system.},

	Abstract = {Members of both calpain and caspase protease families can degrade several components of focal adhesions, leading to disassembly of these complexes. In this report, we investigated the disappearance of tensin from cell adhesion sites of chicken embryonic fibroblast cells (CEFs) exposed to etoposide and demonstrated that loss of tensin from cell adhesions during etoposide-induced apoptosis may be due to degradation of tensin by caspase-3. Tensin cleavage by caspase-3 at the sequence DYPD(1226)G separates the amino-terminal region containing the actin binding domain and the carboxyl-terminal region containing the SH2 domain. The resultant carboxyl-terminal fragment of tensin is unable to bind phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) transducing cell survival signaling. We also demonstrated that overexpression of the amino-terminal tensin fragment induced disruption of actin cytoskeleton in chicken embryonic fibroblasts. Therefore, caspase-mediated cleavage of tensin contributes to the disruption of actin organization and interrupts ECM-mediated survival signals through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.},

	Abstract = {The reconstruction problem in in-line X-ray Phase-Contrast Tomography is usually approached by solving two independent linearized sub-problems: phase retrieval and tomographic reconstruction. Both problems are often ill-posed and require the use of regularization techniques that lead to artifacts in the reconstructed image. We present a novel reconstruction approach that solves two coupled linear problems algebraically. Our approach is based on the assumption that the frequency space of the tomogram can be divided into bands that are accurately recovered and bands that are undefined by the observations. This results in an underdetermined linear system of equations. We investigate how this system can be solved using three different algebraic reconstruction algorithms based on Total Variation minimization. These algorithms are compared using both simulated and experimental data. Our results demonstrate that in many cases the proposed algebraic algorithms yield a significantly improved accuracy over the conventional L2-regularized closed-form solution. This work demonstrates that algebraic algorithms may become an important tool in applications where the acquisition time and the delivered radiation dose must be minimized.},

Gelsolin was identified as a substrate for caspase-3 by screening the translation products of small complementary DNA pools for sensitivity to cleavage by caspase-3. Gelsolin was cleaved in vivo in a caspase-dependent manner in cells stimulated by Fas. Caspase-cleaved gelsolin severed actin filaments in vitro in a Ca2+-independent manner. Expression of the gelsolin cleavage product in multiple cell types caused the cells to round up, detach from the plate, and undergo nuclear fragmentation. Neutrophils isolated from mice lacking gelsolin had delayed onset of both blebbing and DNA fragmentation, following apoptosis induction, compared with wild-type neutrophils. Thus, cleaved gelsolin may be one physiological effector of morphologic change during apoptosis.},

SPQ was loaded into cells of the in vitro microperfused rabbit proximal convoluted tubule by a 10 min luminal perfusion with 20 mM SPQ at 38 degrees C. Fluorescence was excited with a broad band excitation filter (340 and 380 nm) and detected with a 435 nm cut-on filter. The signal to background (autofluorescence) ratio was 4.6 +/- 0.6. The halftime for SPQ leakage from cells at 38 degrees C was 8.6 +/- 1.1 min. In suspended tubules, SPQ did not affect O2 consumption significantly. Intracellular SPQ calibration was performed using the ionophores nigericin and tributyltin, high external potassium concentrations, and varying extracellular chloride concentrations. Cell fluorescence was related to intracellular chloride by a Stern-Volmer relation with a quenching constant of 12 M-1. Apparent chloride concentration in tubules perfused with solutions characteristic for the late proximal convoluted tubule was 27.5 +/- 5 mM (activity 20.6 mM). The halftime of the transient in cell chloride activity upon bath chloride addition was approximately 3 s (38 degrees C). Applications and limitations of this new fluorescence method to study cell chloride transport are discussed.},

@article{Krumschnabel2007,
	Abstract = {Apoptotic cell death in mammalian models is frequently associated with cell shrinkage. Inhibition of apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) is cytoprotective, suggesting that cell shrinkage is an important early event in apoptosis. In salmonid hepatoma and gill cells staurosporine induced apoptosis, as assessed by activation of effector caspases, nuclear condensation, and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and these changes were accompanied by cell shrinkage. The Cl- transport inhibitor DIDS and the K+ channel inhibitor quinidine prevented AVD, but only DIDS inhibited apoptosis. Other Cl- flux inhibitors, as well as a pan-caspase inhibitor, did not prevent cell shrinkage, but still prevented caspase activation. Furthermore, regulatory volume decrease (RVD) under hypotonic conditions was not facilitated, but diminished in apoptotic cells. Since all transport inhibitors used blocked RVD, but only DIDS and quinidine inhibited AVD, the ion transporters involved in both processes are apparently not identical. In addition, our data indicate that inhibition of Cl- fluxes rather than blocking cell shrinkage or K+ fluxes is important for preventing apoptosis. In line with this, inhibition of MAP kinases reduced RVD and not AVD, but still diminished caspase activation. Finally, we observed that MAP kinases were activated upon staurosporine treatment and that at least activation of ERK was prevented when AVD was inhibited.},

	Abstract = {To survive, cells have to avoid excessive alterations of cell volume that jeopardize structural integrity and constancy of intracellular milieu. The function of cellular proteins seems specifically sensitive to dilution and concentration, determining the extent of macromolecular crowding. Even at constant extracellular osmolarity, volume constancy of any mammalian cell is permanently challenged by transport of osmotically active substances across the cell membrane and formation or disappearance of cellular osmolarity by metabolism. Thus cell volume constancy requires the continued operation of cell volume regulatory mechanisms, including ion transport across the cell membrane as well as accumulation or disposal of organic osmolytes and metabolites. The various cell volume regulatory mechanisms are triggered by a multitude of intracellular signaling events including alterations of cell membrane potential and of intracellular ion composition, various second messenger cascades, phosphorylation of diverse target proteins, and altered gene expression. Hormones and mediators have been shown to exploit the volume regulatory machinery to exert their effects. Thus cell volume may be considered a second message in the transmission of hormonal signals. Accordingly, alterations of cell volume and volume regulatory mechanisms participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including epithelial transport, metabolism, excitation, hormone release, migration, cell proliferation, and cell death.},

	Abstract = {Cell shrinkage is a hallmark and contributes to signaling of apoptosis. Apoptotic cell shrinkage requires ion transport across the cell membrane involving K(+) channels, Cl(-) or anion channels, Na(+)/H(+) exchange, Na(+),K(+),Cl(-) cotransport, and Na(+)/K(+)ATPase. Activation of K(+) channels fosters K(+) exit with decrease of cytosolic K(+) concentration, activation of anion channels triggers exit of Cl(-), organic osmolytes, and HCO3(-). Cellular loss of K(+) and organic osmolytes as well as cytosolic acidification favor apoptosis. Ca(2+) entry through Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels may result in apoptosis by affecting mitochondrial integrity, stimulating proteinases, inducing cell shrinkage due to activation of Ca(2+)-sensitive K(+) channels, and triggering cell-membrane scrambling. Signaling involved in the modification of cell-volume regulatory ion transport during apoptosis include mitogen-activated kinases p38, JNK, ERK1/2, MEKK1, MKK4, the small G proteins Cdc42, and/or Rac and the transcription factor p53. Osmosensing involves integrin receptors, focal adhesion kinases, and tyrosine kinase receptors. Hyperosmotic shock leads to vesicular acidification followed by activation of acid sphingomyelinase, ceramide formation, release of reactive oxygen species, activation of the tyrosine kinase Yes with subsequent stimulation of CD95 trafficking to the cell membrane. Apoptosis is counteracted by mechanisms involved in regulatory volume increase (RVI), by organic osmolytes, by focal adhesion kinase, and by heat-shock proteins. Clearly, our knowledge on the interplay between cell-volume regulatory mechanisms and suicidal cell death is still far from complete and substantial additional experimental effort is needed to elucidate the role of cell-volume regulatory mechanisms in suicidal cell death.},

	Abstract = {Phase sensitive x-ray imaging extends standard x-ray microscopy techniques by offering up to a thousand times higher sensitivity than absorption-based techniques. If an object is illuminated with a sufficiently coherent beam, phase contrast is achieved by moving the detector downstream from the object. There is a quantitative relationship between the phase shift induced by the object and the recorded intensity. This relationship can be used to retrieve the phase shift induced by the object through the solution of an inverse problem. Since the phase shift can be considered as a projection through the 3D refractive index, the latter can be reconstructed using standard tomographic inversion techniques. However, the determination of the phase shift from the recorded intensity is an ill-posed inverse problem. We investigate the application of Fourier-wavelet regularized deconvolution (ForWaRD) to this problem. The method is evaluated using simulated and experimental data and is shown to increase the quality of reconstructions, in terms of normalized RMS error and compared with standard Tikhonov regularization, at a three times increase in computational cost.},

	Abstract = {The phase-retrieval problem for a physical system with strong support constraints is investigated. Propagation of an optical field in a system with no variation along one transverse axis results in cylindrical wave fronts. Scalar propagation in such systems is a purely two-dimensional process. We show that, given the optical intensity in a plane, the phase of the wave field can be calculated directly if the system has this special symmetry. The procedure relies on a simple geometric relation between the system pupil function (or angular spectrum) and the system optical transfer function in the Debye theory of scalar wave focusing. The inherent autocorrelation operation can be undone, and the phase directly retrieved, with a simple coordinate transformation.},

Here, we report that demise of human T cells caused by two classic apoptotic triggers (staurosporin and CD95 stimulation) changed from apoptosis to necrosis, when cells were preemptied of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation did not occur in cells predepleted of ATP and treated with either of the two inducers, although the kinetics of cell death were unchanged. Selective and graded repletion of the extramitochondrial ATP/pool with glucose prevented necrosis and restored the ability of the cells to undergo apoptosis. Pulsed ATP/depletion/repletion experiments also showed that ATP generation either by glycolysis or by mitochondria was required for the active execution of the final phase of apoptosis, which involves nuclear condensation and DNA degradation.},

	Abstract = {A rapid focus-detection technique based directly on the spectral content of digital holograms is developed. It differs from previous approaches in that it does not need a full reconstruction of the image. The technique uses l(1) norms of object spectral components associated with the real and imaginary parts of the reconstruction kernel. Further, the l(1) norms can be computed efficiently in the spatial frequency domain using a polar coordinate system, yielding a drastic speedup of similar to 2 orders of magnitude compared with image-based focus detection. Significant computational savings are achieved when subsequent image reconstructions are done selectively over the detected focus distances. Focus-detection results from holograms of plankton are demonstrated that show the technique is both accurate and robust. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America.},

	Abstract = {Transmembrane water fluxes through aquaporins (AQPs) are suggested to play pivotal roles in cell polarization and directional cell motility. Local dilution by water influences the dynamics of the subcortical actin polymerization and directs the formation of nascent membrane protrusions. In this paper, recent evidence is discussed in support of such a central role of AQP in membrane protrusion formation and cell migration as a basis for our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of directional motility. Specifically, AQP9 in a physiological context controls transmembrane water fluxes driving membrane protrusion formation, as an initial cellular response to a chemoattractant or other migratory signals. The importance of AQP-facilitated water fluxes in directional cell motility is underscored by the observation that blocking or modifying specific sites in AQP9 also interferes with the molecular machinery that govern actin-mediated cellular shape changes.},

Here, we demonstrate linear motion deblurring using temporally coded illumination in an LED array microscope. By illuminating moving objects with a well-designed temporal coded sequence that varies during each single camera exposure, the resulting motion blur is invertible and can be computationally removed. This scheme is implemented in an existing LED array microscope, providing benefits of being grayscale, fast, and adaptive, which leads to high-quality deblur performance and a flexible implementation with no moving parts. The proposed method is demonstrated experimentally for fast moving targets in a microfluidic environment.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new technique for 3D shape measurement by recovering the 3D numerical reconstruction image of a digital hologram. Firstly, we fabricate a Fresnel digital hologram. Then, a number of 2D light field intensity distributions, which are in the reconstructed field of the digital hologram, are computed on the different depth planes. Finally, the focus measure evaluation of the grey level variance is applied. By finding the maximum focus measure, we decide on the depth information of each small image patch. The experiment confirms that the technique can materialize the 3D rebuilding of the reconstruction image and obtain 3D profile information on the object recorded. So digital holography can be a very promising technology for non-destructive 3D shape measurement.},

Here we show that an alternative form of multi-measurement imaging, ptychography, can be extended to three dimensions and can successfully recover images in the presence of multiple scattering and when the projection approximation is not applicable. We demonstrate our technique experimentally using visible light, where it has applications in imaging thick samples such as biological tissues; however the results also have important implications for x ray and electron imaging.},

The first method generates an approximate reconstruction directly from the far-field intensity, which is measured as a function of scattering angle for each incident plane wave. The second method uses an iterative phase-retrieval algorithm to extract the phase of the scattered field over any given plane from the measurement of the intensity of the total field over that plane and from a priori object-support information. The reconstruction is then performed from the scattered field that is so determined by using the filtered backpropagation algorithm of diffraction tomography.

	Abstract = {Multiple signaling pathways are known to induce apoptosis in thymocytes through mechanisms that include the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cell shrinkage, caspase activation, and DNA degradation but little is known about the consequences of apoptosis on the properties of the plasma membrane. We have previously shown that apoptotic signals, including survival factor withdrawal and glucocorticoids, induce plasma membrane depolarization during rat thymocyte apoptosis, but the mechanisms involved in this process are unknown. We report here that inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase) with ouabain similarly depolarized control thymocytes and enhanced glucocorticoid-induced membrane depolarization, suggesting a link between Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and plasma membrane depolarization of thymocytes. To determine whether repression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase levels within cells can account for the loss of plasma membrane potential, we assessed protein levels of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in apoptotic thymocytes. Spontaneously dying thymocytes had decreased levels of both catalytic and regulatory subunits of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, and glucocorticoid treatment enhanced the loss of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein. The pan caspase inhibitor (z-VAD) blocked both cellular depolarization and repression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in both spontaneously dying and glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes; however, specific inhibitors of caspase 8, 9, and caspase 3 did not. Interestingly, glucocorticoid treatment simultaneously induced cell shrinkage and depolarization. Furthermore, depolarization and the loss of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein were limited to the shrunken population of cells. The data indicate an important role for Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in both spontaneous and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of rat thymocytes.},

	Abstract = {This work reveals an experimental microscopy acquisition scheme successfully combining compressed sensing (CS) and digital holography in off-axis and frequency-shifting conditions. CS is a recent data acquisition theory involving signal reconstruction from randomly undersampled measurements, exploiting the fact that most images present some compact structure and redundancy. We propose a genuine CS-based imaging scheme for sparse gradient images, acquiring a diffraction map of the optical field with holographic microscopy and recovering the signal from as little as 7\% of random measurements. We report experimental results demonstrating how CS can lead to an elegant and effective way to reconstruct images, opening the door for new microscopy applications.},

	Abstract = {This Letter reports a demonstration of off-axis compressed holography in low-light level imaging conditions. An acquisition protocol relying on a single exposure of a randomly undersampled diffraction map of the optical field, recorded in the high heterodyne gain regime, is proposed. The image acquisition scheme is based on compressed sensing, a theory establishing that near-exact recovery of an unknown sparse signal is possible from a small number of nonstructured measurements. Image reconstruction is further enhanced by introducing an off-axis spatial support constraint to the image estimation algorithm. We report accurate experimental recovering of holographic images of a resolution target in low-light conditions with a frame exposure of 5?$\mu$s, scaling down measurements to 9\% of random pixels within the array detector.},

We use the fact that a common distortion will occur to all coherent modes to separate the distortion from the source behind it, rather than requiring a reference source at a different wavelength. Digital deconvolution was performed on the full four-dimensional partially coherent field for simultaneously computing the distortion and the source intensity distribution.},

The longitudinal resolution of three-dimensional coherence imaging falls inversely with the square of the source distance in both the Fresnel and Fraunhofer zones.

	Abstract = {Tumors result from the imbalance between cell growth and apoptosis. One of the characteristic changes in cancers is the abnormality in cytoskeleton, which suggests some roles of cytoskeletal proteins in tumorigenesis or the maintenance of tumor cells. Previously we showed that cytoskeletal actin is the substrate of caspases, the proteases responsible for apoptosis, while the role of actin cleavage in apoptosis remained unknown. To examine the cleavage of actin in vivo, we extensively performed immunoblot analysis using actin fragment-specific antibody. Here, we showed that, in some solid tumor cells, induction of apoptosis was accompanied by caspase-dependent actin-cleavage to 15 and 31 kDa fragments in vivo. To elucidate the role of actin-cleavage further, we introduced actin cleaved-fragments. We found that ectopic expression of an actin 15 kDa fragment induces morphological changes resembling those of apoptotic cells. The expression of the actin fragment induced a dramatic change of cellular actin localization, as visualized by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged actin, while the actin fragment expression did not cause caspase activation nor the cleavage of a marker substrate protein, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. These results indicate that actin cleavage could play a positive role in the morphological changes of apoptosis downstream of caspase activation.},

Here we show, using a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP), that mitochondria-dependent apoptotic stimuli (such as Bax, staurosporine and ultraviolet irradiation) induce rapid, Bcl-2-inhibitable mitochondrial alkalinization and cytosol acidification, followed by cytC release, caspase activation and mitochondrial swelling and depolarization. These events are not induced by mitochondria-independent apoptotic stimuli, such as Fas. Activation of cytosolic caspases by cytC in vitro is minimal at neutral pH, but maximal at acidic pH, indicating that mitochondria-induced acidification of the cytosol may be important for caspase activation; this finding is supported by results obtained from cells using protonophores. Cytosol acidification and cytC release are suppressed by oligomycin, a FoF1-ATPase/H +-pump inhibitor, but not by caspase inhibitors. Ectopic expression of Bax in wild-type, but not FoF1/H+-pump-deficient, yeast cells similarly results in mitochondrial matrix alkalinization, cytosol acidification and cell death. These findings indicate that mitochondria-mediated alteration of intracellular pH may be an early event that regulates caspase activation in the mitochondrial pathway for apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {Mitochondria play a critical role in apoptosis induction in response to myriad stimuli. These organelles release proteins into the cytosol which trigger caspase activation or perform other functions relevant to apoptosis, including cytochrome c (cyt-c), caspases, AIF, and SMAC (Diablo). The mechanisms by which these proteins escape from mitochondria remain enigmatic. Moreover, it is unclear whether release of these proteins versus disturbances in core mitochondrial functions represents the cell death commitment mechanism. In this regard, suppression of apoptosis using broad-spectrum caspase inhibitory compounds has been reported in many circumstances to prevent the morphological and biochemical manifestations of apoptosis, and yet not protect cells from death and not preserve clonigenic survival. Thus, while mitochondrial damage can be coupled to caspase activation pathways, cell death commitment often occurs upstream of caspase activation when mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways are invoked. Here, we review evidence implicating dysregulation of cellular pH as a component of the cell death mechanism involving mitochondria. Cell Death and Differentiation (2000) 7, 1155 - 1165},

	Abstract = {In this study we have shown that redistribution of the lipid composition of the external and internal leaflets of the PM during apoptosis results in two main alterations in the cell surface, externalisation of PS, and a looser packing of the lipid hydrophobic head groups in the external leaflet. Significantly, neither of these alterations can be directly implicated in the mechanism of apoptotic cell shrinkage, however they do have functions in other phases of the apoptotic process. Progressional studies involving morphological and flow cytometric evaluation, and DNA gel electrophoresis revealed that apoptotic cell shrinkage is associated with a decrease in [Na+]i and [K+]i which occurs after visualisation of chromatin condensation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and prior to apoptotic body formation. When apoptotic cultures were supplemented with inhibitors of the Na+, K+-ATPase pump or the Ca2+-dependent K+ channel, essentially all of the respective Na+ or K+ efflux during apoptosis can be inhibited, suggesting that essentially all of the Na+ and K+ efflux can be ascribed to active pumping via the Na+, K+-ATPase pump and the Ca2+-dependent K+ channel.},

	Abstract = {Although apoptosis and necrosis were originally thought to be entirely distinct mechanisms of cell death, recent work has shown that the processes are regulated by many of the same biochemical intermediates, most notably the levels of cellular ATP, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species, and thiol antioxidants. Beyond a certain threshold, it appears that stress-induced changes in these modulators 'switches' the cell death mechanism from apoptosis to necrosis. Importantly, even when this occurs, cell death can be attenuated by bcl-2 and caspase inhibitors, which are known for their abilities to block apoptosis. This review will summarize these observations within the context of what is currently known about the effector machinery for apoptotic cell death, and possible mechanistic explanations for the switch between apoptosis and necrosis will be provided.},

	Abstract = {This dissertation presents a framework for modeling transmission effects due to three-dimensional mask topography in optical lithography from solving Maxwell's equations using rigorous simulation through fast-CAD for full chip level aerial image quality characterization in optical projection printing. As the semiconductor industry advances to the 22nm node where features are sub-wavelength, lithography imaging must be accurate to the nanometer. Non-ideal transmission caused by scattering off of mask edges has become an increasingly important source of inaccuracies in lithography modeling. Here mask edge effects are treated in two modules: modeling the near field scattering phenomena and then moving that information into fast-CAD first cut accurate simulation. Phase errors induced by mask edges lead to an asymmetric behavior through focus, which lead to significant loss in the process window. For even conservative imaging scenarios up to 40% of the focus latitude is lost. An experimental approach is presented, which uses gratings to characterize the polarization dependent magnitude of these errors as might be utilized in an inexpensive mask monitoring apparatus. A second simulation based method directly analyzes near field behavior with simulation, providing more accurate phase information as well as guidelines for edge-to-edge cross-talk. A MoSi attenuating 180 degree phase shift mask is shown to have boundary layer values of about 20 nm (1/10 wavelengths) in mask dimensions even for high off-axis illumination. Non-attenuating chromeless masks and complicated mask stacks such as TaSiO2 showed significant electromagnetic errors as high as 1/4 wavelengths. A study of a hypothetical thin mask showed that the phase effects are inherent to the use of neighboring phase wells. The most significant contribution of this dissertation is the development of Source-Pupil Kernel Convolution with Pattern Matching (SP-KCPM) that connects the information gained from boundary layer modeling to fast-CAD pattern matching tools, achieving a 10^4 speedup compared to conventional imaging. Full complex interactions are included, and along with a pupil-based framework enables more general imaging by including additional phenomena such as defocus, Zernike aberrations, measured aberrations, and potentially resist and polarization effects. Proximity effects between features are also accounted for, removing the need for a prior image calculation or restrictions to a specific image contour. A new coherent source model combined with source splitting is used to generalize the aerial image quality assessment to distributed off-axis sources utilized in advanced resolution enhancement techniques. This distributed source-pupil based convolution method has guaranteed accuracy well beyond that historically reported for pattern matching methods at full chip speeds, thus enabling many new applications. For dipole, annular, quad, and pixelated optimized sources, R^2 correlation is shown to be above 0.99. Additionally, effects of defocus, Zernike aberrations, background aberrations, and asymmetric sources have all been shown to be accurate. SP-KCPM was tested on highly pixelated sources used in source-mask-optimization, and accuracy of R^2 = 0.99 was achieved on general layouts by splitting the source into 12 regions. This capability is used to demonstrate the ability to make decisions between source distributions and mask blanks. Hotspot detection is used to quickly make decisions between sources or mask types by assessing the impact an optimized source solution over a larger non-optimized layout region. Real time tracking of mask changes opens the door for SP-KCPM to be used for optimization techniques and optical proximity correction. SP-KCPM is shown to be a general tool, useful wherever fast imaging is at a premium with applicability in many forms of optical imaging such as inspection and character recognition, in addition to standard projection printing.},

	Abstract = {We propose a method to image the surface topography of transparent objects. The space between the object and the opposite closely positioned surface (such as a cover glass or a slide) is filled with a strongly absorbing dye. The contrast is generated by recording a transmission image at a wavelength where the dye absorbs. Since the transmitted intensity depends on the depth of the dye layer, it carries information about the relief of the tested surface. With sufficiently concentrated dyes, nanometre unevenness of a surface can be detected. By using less-concentrated solutions, it is possible to image and measure larger objects, such as biological cells. At the present stage, biological applications of the method are only semi-quantitative, but the method still provides detailed information about cell shapes that is not readily obtainable with other imaging techniques. Conversion of the image grey scale into the units of vertical distance requires knowledge of the absorption coefficient of the dye. The same method that is used for imaging can be adapted to measure the absorption coefficient of concentrated dyes. The solution to be analyzed is placed between a glass slide and a spherical lens of known radius. The absorption coefficient is determined from attenuation of transmitted intensity as a function of the distance to the centre. At the same time, the interference pattern in the reflected image allows measurement of the refractive index of the dye.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular water plays a critical role in apoptotic and necrotic cell death. We describe a method for quantifying cell water by application of two previously described variants of transmission microscopy. By taking two axially displaced brightfield images, the phase shift of the transmitted wave was computed using the transport-of-intensity equation. At the same time, cell thickness was determined by transmission through an externally applied dye ("transmission-through-dye" microscopy); switching between these two imaging modalities was accomplished by simply changing the illumination wavelength. The sets of data thus obtained allow computation of the refractive index and cell water content within individual cells. The method was illustrated using cells treated with apoptotic agents staurosporine and actinomycin D and with necrosis inducer ionomycin. Water imaging allows discrimination between apoptotic volume decrease due to dehydration from that due to detachment of apoptotic bodies and can be used on samples where cell volume determination alone would be difficult or insufficient.},

	Abstract = {Cell shrinkage and dehydration are essential characteristics of apoptosis, and the loss of as much as half of the initial cell volume is not uncommon. This phenomenon is usually explained by the efflux of potassium and chloride ions. We reexamine this hypothesis based on the available data for ion concentrations and taking into account the requirements for osmotic equilibrium and electroneutrality. In addition to ion loss, the possible impacts of several other processes are discussed: the efflux of low-molecular osmolytes, acidification of the cytosol, the effects of water channels and pumps, heterogeneity of intracellular water and dissociation of apoptotic bodies. We conclude that most mammalian cells are theoretically capable of reducing their volume by 15-20\% through ion loss or a decrease in cytosolic pH, although in reality the contribution of these mechanisms to apoptotic shrinkage may be smaller. Transitions between osmotically active and inactive water pools might influence cell volume as well; these mechanisms are poorly understood but are amenable to experimental study. Dissociation of apoptotic bodies is a separate mechanism of volume reduction; it should be monitored closely, which can be best achieved by measuring intracellular water rather than cell volume.},

Information on the spectral content of backscattered light is obtained by detection and processing of the interferometric OCT signal. This method allows the spectrum of backscattered light to be measured over the entire available optical bandwidth simultaneously in a single measurement. Specific spectral features can be extracted by use of digital signal processing without changing the measurement apparatus. An ultrabroadband femtosecond Ti:Al2O3 laser was used to achieve spectroscopic imaging over the wavelength range from 650 to 1000 nm in a simple model as well as in vivo in the Xenopus laevis (African frog) tadpole. Multidimensional spectroscopic data are displayed by use of a novel hue-saturation false-color mapping.},

	Abstract = {A method is presented for quantitative polychromatic cone-beam phase-contrast tomographic imaging of a single-material object from few projections. This algorithm exploits the natural combination of binary tomography with a phase-retrieval method that makes explicit use of the single-material nature of the sample. Such consistent use of a priori knowledge reduces the number of required projections, implying significantly reduced dose and scanning time when compared to existing phase-contrast tomography methods. Reconstructions from simulated datasets are used to investigate the effects of noise and establish a minimum required number of projections. An experimental demonstration is then given, using data from a point-projection X-ray microscope. Here, the complex distribution of refractive index in a sample containing several nylon fibers with diameters between 100 $\mu$m and 420 $\mu$m is reconstructed at a spatial resolution of ~4 $\mu$m from 20 polychromatic phase-contrast projection images with a mean photon energy of 8.4 keV.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis is a genetically programmed and physiological mode of cell death that leads to the removal of unwanted or abnormal cells. Cysteine-proteases called caspases are responsible for the apoptotic execution phase which is characterized by specific biochemical events as well as morphological changes. These changes, which lead to the orderly dismantling of the apoptotic cell, include cell contraction, dynamic membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, nuclear disintegration, cell fragmentation followed by phagocytosis of the dying cell. They involve major modifications of the cytoskeleton which are largely mediated by cleavage of several of its components by caspases. For example, dynamic membrane blebbing is due to the increased contractility of the acto-myosin system following myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. MLC phosphorylation is a consequence of the cleavage of a Rho GTPase effector, the kinase ROCK I, by caspase-3. This cleavage induces a constitutive kinase activity by removal of an inhibitory domain. Chromatin condensation is facilitated by the processing of lamins by caspases. Collapse of the cytokeratin network is mediated by cleavage of keratin 18. On another hand, the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement needed in the phagocyte for engulfment of the dying cell is due to the activation of the small GTPase Rac, a GTPase of the Rho family that induces actin polymerisation and formation of lamellipodia. In addition to mediating the morphological modifications of the apoptotic cell, several proteins of the cytoskeleton such as actin and keratins are also involved in the regulation of apoptotic signaling.},

@article{Newton1999,
	Abstract = {Controlled ovarian stimulation during an in vitro fertilization cycle usually produces large numbers of oocytes and, consequently, it is likely that more embryos will be generated than can be transferred in a given cycle. It is desirable to freeze-bank surplus oocytes before insemination to avoid the ethical and legal complications of disposing of or storing embryos. Although many attempts have been made to cryopreserve human oocytes, to date, post-thaw survival has been poor, and viable pregnancies after in vitro fertilization have been rare. A possible explanation for the lack of success is that the freezing methods have been adapted from animal studies but have not been optimized for the human oocyte. In this study, video microscopy was used to determine the volumetric responses of mature human oocytes to changes in osmolarity during preparation for freezing. A Boyle van't Hoff plot of data collected in static experiments with fresh human oocytes gave a value of 0.19 +/- 0.01 (mean +/- SEM) for the osmotically inactive volume. Dynamic measurements during exposure to dimethyl sulphoxide at room temperature (22 degrees C) were analysed by a two-parameter transport model and produced values of 1.30 x 10(-6) cm atm-1 s-1 for the hydraulic conductivity of the plasma membrane and 3.15 x 10(-5) cm s-1 for dimethyl sulphoxide permeability (chi-squared = 0.43, df = 20) of fresh human oocytes. Oocytes that had failed to fertilize had a slightly lower hydraulic conductivity and dimethyl sulphoxide permeability and, after exposure to 1.5 mol dimethyl sulphoxide l-1, these cells appeared to become permeable to normally impermeable solutes. These permeability properties have been used to design a protocol for the addition and removal of dimethyl sulphoxide to control the magnitude of volumetric changes.},

@article{Nobel2000,
	Abstract = {To investigate the involvement of K+ efflux in apoptotic cell shrinkage, we monitored efflux of the K+ congener, 86Rb+, and cell volume during CD95-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. An anti-CD95 antibody caused apoptosis associated with intracellular GSH depletion, a significant increase in 86Rb+ efflux, and a decrease in cell volume compared with control cells. Preincubating Jurkat cells with Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (VAD-cmk), an inhibitor of caspase proteases, prevented the observed 86Rb+ efflux and cell shrinkage induced by the anti-CD95 antibody. A wide range of inhibitors against most types of K+ channels could not inhibit CD95-mediated efflux of 86Rb+, however, the uptake of 86Rb+ by Jurkat cells was severely compromised when treated with anti-CD95 antibody. Uptake of 86Rb+ in Jurkat cells was sensitive to ouabain (a specific Na+/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor), demonstrating Na+/K(+)-ATPase dependent K+ uptake. Ouabain induced significant 86Rb+ efflux in untreated cells, as well as it seemed to compete with 86Rb+ efflux induced by the anti-CD95 antibody, supporting a role for Na+/K(+)-ATPase in the CD95-mediated 86Rb+ efflux. Ouabain treatment of Jurkat cells did not cause a reduction in cell volume, although together with the anti-CD95 antibody, ouabain potentiated CD95-mediated cell shrinkage. This suggests that the observed inhibition of Na+/K(+)-ATPase during apoptosis may also facilitate apoptotic cell shrinkage.},

	Abstract = {The cell is a crowded volume, with estimated mean mass percentage of macromolecules and of water ranging from 7.5 to 45 and 55 to 92.5?\%, respectively. However, the concentrations of macromolecules and water at the nanoscale within the various cell compartments are unknown. We recently developed a new approach, correlative cryo-analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy, for mapping the quantity of water within compartments previously shown to display GFP-tagged protein fluorescence on the same ultrathin cryosection. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS), we then identified various elements (C, N, O, P, S, K, Cl, Mg) in these compartments and quantified them in mmol/l. Here, we used this new approach to quantify water and elements in the cytosol, mitochondria, condensed chromatin, nucleoplasm, and nucleolar components of control and stressed cancerous cells. The water content of the control cells was between 60 and 83?\% (in the mitochondria and nucleolar fibrillar centers, respectively). Potassium was present at concentrations of 128-462?mmol/l in nucleolar fibrillar centers and condensed chromatin, respectively. The induction of nucleolar stress by treatment with a low dose of actinomycin-D to inhibit rRNA synthesis resulted in both an increase in water content and a decrease in the elements content in all cell compartments. We generated a nanoscale map of water and elements within the cell compartments, providing insight into their changes induced by nucleolar stress.},

Due to the property of the Laplace transform, a broader range of signals can be represented in complex phase--space. We show that the Laplace kernel Wigner function exhibits similar properties in the marginals as the traditional Wigner function. As an example, we use the Laplace kernel Wigner function to analyze evanescent waves supported by surface plasmon polariton.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental property of animal cells is the ability to regulate their own cell volume. Even under hypotonic stress imposed by either decreased extracellular or increased intracellular osmolarity, the cells can re-adjust their volume after transient osmotic swelling by a mechanism known as regulatory volume decrease (RVD). In most cell types, RVD is accomplished mainly by KCl efflux induced by parallel activation of K+ and Cl- channels. We have studied the molecular mechanism of RVD in a human epithelial cell line (Intestine 407). Osmotic swelling results in a significant increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and thereby activates intermediate-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ (IK) channels. Osmotic swelling also induces ATP release from the cells to the extracellular compartment. Released ATP stimulates purinergic ATP (P2Y2) receptors, thereby inducing phospholipase C-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. Thus, RVD is facilitated by stimulation of P2Y2 receptors due to augmentation of IK channels. In contrast, stimulation of another G protein-coupled Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) enhances the activity of volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying Cl- channels, thereby facilitating RVD. Therefore, it is possible that Ca2+ efflux stimulated by swelling-induced and P2Y2 receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization activates the CaR, thereby secondarily upregulating the volume-regulatory Cl- conductance. On the other hand, the initial process towards apoptotic cell death is coupled to normotonic cell shrinkage, called apoptotic volume decrease (AVD). Stimulation of death receptors, such as TNF receptor and Fas, induces AVD and thereafter biochemical apoptotic events in human lymphoid (U937), human epithelial (HeLa), mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid (NG108-15) and rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells. In those cells exhibiting AVD, facilitation of RVD is always observed. Both AVD induction and RVD facilitation as well as succeeding apoptotic events can be abolished by prior treatment with a blocker of volume-regulatory K+ or Cl- channels, suggesting that AVD is caused by normotonic activation of ion channels that are normally involved in RVD under hypotonic conditions. Therefore, it is likely that G protein-coupled receptors involved in RVD regulation and death receptors triggering AVD may share common downstream signals which should give us key clues to the detailed mechanisms of volume regulation and survival of animal cells. In this Topical Review, we look at the physiological ionic mechanisms of cell volume regulation and cell death-associated volume changes from the facet of receptor-mediated cellular processes.},

	Abstract = {Cell death is accompanied by the dissipation of electrochemical gradients of monovalent ions across the plasma membrane that, in turn, affects cell volume via modulation of intracellular osmolyte content. In numerous cell types, apoptotic and necrotic stimuli caused cell shrinkage and swelling, respectively. Thermodynamics predicts a cell type-specific rather than an ubiquitous impact of monovalent ion transporters on volume perturbations in dying cells, suggesting their diverse roles in the cell death machinery. Indeed, recent data showed that apoptotic collapse may occur in the absence of cell volume changes and even follow cell swelling rather than shrinkage. Moreover, side-by-side with cell volume adjustment, monovalent ion transporters contribute to cell death machinery engagement independently of volume regulation via cell type-specific signaling pathways. Thus, inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by cardiotonic steroids (CTS) rescues rat vascular smooth muscle cells from apoptosis via a novel Na(+)i-K(+)i-mediated, Ca(2+)i-independent mechanism of excitation-transcription coupling. In contrast, CTS kill renal epithelial cells independently of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibition and increased [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i ratio. The molecular origin of [Na(+)]i/[K(+)]i sensors involved in the inhibition of apoptosis as well as upstream intermediates of Na(+)i/K(+)i-independent death signaling triggered by CTS remain unknown.},

This EPRY-FPM algorithm eliminates the requirement of the previous FPM algorithm for a priori knowledge of the aberration in the imaging system to reconstruct a high quality image. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by reconstructing high resolution, large field-of-view images of biological samples. We also illustrate that the pupil function we retrieve can be used to study the spatially varying aberration of a large field-of-view imaging system.

	Abstract = {Digital holography appears to be a strong contender as the next-generation technology for holographic diagnostics of particle fields and holographic particle image velocimetry for flow field measurement. With the digital holographic approach, holograms are directly recorded by a digital camera and reconstructed numerically. This not only eliminates wet chemical processing and mechanical scanning, but also enables the use of complex amplitude information inaccessible by optical reconstruction, thereby allowing flexible reconstruction algorithms to achieve optimization of specific information. However, owing to the inherently low pixel resolution of solid-state imaging sensors, digital holography gives poor depth resolution for images, a problem that severely impairs the usefulness of digital holography especially in densely populated particle fields. This paper describes a technique that significantly improves particle axial-location accuracy by exploring the reconstructed complex amplitude information, compared with other numerical reconstruction schemes that merely mimic traditional optical reconstruction. This novel method allows accurate extraction of particle locations from forward-scattering particle holograms even at high particle loadings.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis is an active process with distinct features including loss of cell volume, chromatin condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. Among the classical characteristics that define apoptosis, the loss of cell volume has become a very important component of the programmed cell death process. Changes in cell volume result from alterations in the homeostasis of ions and in particular the movement of Na+ and K+ ions. Most living cells have a high concentration of intracellular K+ and a low concentration of intracellular Na+. This is in contrast to the outside of the cell, where there is a high concentration of extracellular Na+ and a low concentration of extracellular K+. Thus a concentration gradient exists for the loss and gain of intracellular K+ and Na+, respectively. This gradient is maintained through the activity of various ionic channels and transporters, but predominantly the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. During apoptosis, there is compelling evidence indicating an early increase in intracellular Na+ followed by a decrease in both intracellular K+ and Na+ suggesting a regulatory role for these cations during both the initial signalling, and the execution phase of apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that the Na+/K+-ATPase is involved in controlling perturbations of Na+ and K+ homeostasis during apoptosis, and that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL molecules influence these ionic fluxes. Finally, understanding the regulation or deregulation of ionic homeostasis during apoptosis is critical to facilitate the treatment of cardiovascular, neurological, and renal diseases where apoptosis is known to play a major role.},

	Abstract = {In a three-dimensional display scheme based on integral imaging, the mismatch of the system parameters between the pickup and display systems or between the display systems is an important issue from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose a method that provides excellent flexibility to the integral imaging system parameters and display conditions. In the proposed method, elemental images obtained in the pickup process are digitally analyzed and full three-dimensional information of the object is extracted. The extracted three-dimensional information is then transmitted to each display system and modified, so as to be suitable for the display conditions and the system parameters of the display system. Finally elemental images are generated with the modified three-dimensional information for the display system and integrated in the form of a three-dimensional image.},

@article{Pelts2011,
	Abstract = {Conventional light microscopy techniques are poorly suited for imaging the vertical cell dimension. This can be accomplished using transmission-through-dye (TTD) imaging, in which cell thickness is directly converted into image intensity in the presence of extracellular dye with strong absorption. We have previously described applications of TTD to living cells using the dye Acid Blue 9 (AB9) to generate contrast. In this work, we investigated the possibility of extending TTD to chemically fixed cells. This would depend on preservation of cell impermeability to the dye; by using a method based on fluorescence quenching, we found that formaldehyde-fixed cells remain impermeable to AB9. Fixation enables imaging of cell surfaces in the presence of high concentrations of AB9, bringing the vertical resolution to several nanometers per pixel; that is at least an order of magnitude better than resolution achievable with live cells. TTD images collected with high-NA objectives are often contaminated by Becke lines resulting from intracellular organelles, and we show how to distinguish them from features on the cell surface. Quantification of cell thickness and volume on fixed cells is also possible during the early stages of fixation; this can be useful, for example, for measuring volume kinetics following rapid introduction of a stimulus.},

	Abstract = {Non-selective cationic channels (NSCC) are a heterogeneous family of channels, widely expressed in non-excitable and excitable cells, that share several functional characteristics but have diverse molecular origin. NSCC can be formed by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, calcium activated non-selective channels, hyperpolarization activated cation currents, acid-sensitive cationic channels (ASIC), etc. As a result of its wide expression, as well as to the fact that the activation of such currents produce a persistent membrane depolarization, NSCC have been involved in a variety of neuronal processes such as signal transduction, firing pattern (including plateau potentials and bursting mechanisms) as well as synaptic transmission. Due to the relevance of such channels, alterations in their normal function have been associated with the pathophysiology of several nervous system diseases. Over the last years several blockers of such channels have been discovered. Here we review the pharmacology of NSCC blockers including trivalent cations, verapamil derivates, flufenamic acid, the "typical" TRP blockers 2-APB, ACA and SKF 96365 as well as ASIC blockers. This review focuses on the pharmacological properties of such drugs and their potential use for the understanding of the nervous system as well as for the treatment of neurological diseases.},

Two formulas are derived: The first uses all rays to calculate the cross-spectral density exactly, while the second uses only the subset of those rays that pass through a single spatial point to construct an infinite series expression for the cross-spectral density. The evaluation of the truncated series is examined numerically for a variety of fields of varying angular width and coherence and is found to exhibit better convergence to the cross-spectral density when the rays through the centroid between the two observation points are used, when the fields are less coherent, and when the fields are more paraxial. In generalizing the series formula, two new cross-spectral correlations associated with the flux and energy density are examined.},

  abstract =   {<p>We demonstrate the design and application of an add-on device for improving the diagnostic and research capabilities of CellScope?a low-cost, smartphone-based point-of-care microscope. We replace the single LED illumination of the original CellScope with a programmable domed LED array. By leveraging recent advances in computational illumination, this new device enables simultaneous multi-contrast imaging with brightfield, darkfield, and phase imaging modes. Further, we scan through illumination angles to capture lightfield datasets, which can be used to recover 3D intensity and phase images without any hardware changes. This digital refocusing procedure can be used for either 3D imaging or software-only focus correction, reducing the need for precise mechanical focusing during field experiments. All acquisition and processing is performed on the mobile phone and controlled through a smartphone application, making the computational microscope compact and portable. Using multiple samples and different objective magnifications, we demonstrate that the performance of our device is comparable to that of a commercial microscope. This unique device platform extends the field imaging capabilities of CellScope, opening up new clinical and research possibilities.</p>},

	Abstract = {Contrasting cell volume behaviours (swelling vs. shrinkage) are considered as criteria to distinguish necrosis from apoptosis. In this study, we employed a time-lapse, dual-image surface reconstruction technique to assess the volume of single vascular smooth muscle cells transfected with E1A-adenoviral protein (E1A-VSMC) and undergoing rapid apoptosis in the absence of growth factors or in the presence of staurosporine. After 30- to 60-min lag-phase, serum-deprived E1A-VSMC volume was increased by ~40\%, which preceded maximal increments of caspase-3 activity and chromatin cleavage. Swollen cells underwent rapid apoptotic collapse, documented by plasma membrane budding, and terminated in 10-15?min by the formation of numerous apoptotic bodies. Suppression of apoptosis by inhibition of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and activation of cAMP signalling with ouabain and forskolin, respectively, completely abolished the swelling of serum-deprived E1A-VSMC. In contrast to serum deprivation, apoptotic collapse of staurosporine-treated E1A-VSMC preceded attenuation of their volume by ~30\%. Neither transient hyposmotic swelling nor isosmtotic shrinkage triggered apoptosis. Our results show that cell shrinkage can not be considered as ubiquitous hallmark of apoptosis. The involvement of stimulus-specific cell volume perturbations in initiation and progression of apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells should be examined further.},

@article{Poulsen2010,
	Abstract = {Changes in cell volume and ion gradients across the plasma membrane play a pivotal role in the initiation of apoptosis. Here we explore the kinetics of apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and ion content dynamics in wild-type (WT) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (EATC). In WT EATC, induction of apoptosis with cisplatin (5 muM) leads to three distinctive AVD stages: an early AVD(1) (4-12 h), associated with a 30\% cell water loss; a transition stage AVD(T) ( approximately 12 to 32 h), where cell volume is partly recovered; and a secondary AVD(2) (past 32 h), where cell volume was further reduced. AVD(1) and AVD(2) were coupled to net loss of Cl(-), K(+), Na(+), and amino acids (ninhydrin-positive substances), whereas during AVD(T), Na(+) and Cl(-) were accumulated. MDR EATC was resistant to cisplatin, showing increased viability and less caspase 3 activation. Compared with WT EATC, MDR EATC underwent a less pronounced AVD(1,) an augmented AVD(T), and a delay in induction of AVD(2). Changes in AVD were associated with inhibition of Cl(-) loss during AVD(1), augmented NaCl uptake during AVD(T), and a delay of Cl(-) loss during AVD(2). Application of the anion channel inhibitor NS3728 inhibited AVD and completely abolished the differences in AVD, ionic movements, and caspase 3 activation between WT and MDR EATC. Finally, the maximal capacity of volume-regulated anion channel was found to be strongly repressed in MDR EATC. Together, these data suggest that impairment of AVD, primarily via modulation of NaCl movements, contribute to protection against apoptosis in MDR EATC.},

	Abstract = {Holography of small particles is a newly revived topic because of its importance in holographic particle image velocimetry (HPIV). However, the property of particle images formed through holography remains largely unexplored. This fact undermines the measurement reliability of HPIV techniques and has become one of the obstacles in the full deployment of HPIV. We study the intrinsic aberrations in the holographic particle image introduced by particle light scattering and investigate how accurately holography can deliver information about the particles that are being imaged. Consistent with our experimental observations, simulations based on Mie scattering theory show that even with a perfect hologram the reconstructed particle images demonstrate complex three-dimensional morphologies and bodily shifts. These characteristics, manifested as image aberrations, result from uneven scattering amplitude and phase distributions across the finite aperture of the hologram. Such aberrations degrade the signal-to-noise ratio in the reconstructed image as well as introducing systematic errors in detected particle image positions. We examine the effect of these aberrations on HPIV measurements.},

	Abstract = {The ultimate goal of holographic particle image velocimetry (HPIV) is to provide space- and time-resolved measurement of complex flows. Recent new understanding of holographic imaging of small particles, pertaining to intrinsic aberration and noise in particular, has enabled us to elucidate fundamental issues in HPIV and implement a new HPIV system. This system is based on our previously reported off-axis HPIV setup, but the design is optimized by incorporating our new insights of holographic particle imaging characteristics. Furthermore, the new system benefits from advanced data processing algorithms and distributed parallel computing technology. Because of its robustness and efficiency, for the first time to our knowledge, the goal of both temporally and spatially resolved flow measurements becomes tangible. We demonstrate its temporal measurement capability by a series of phase-locked dynamic measurements of instantaneous three-dimensional, three-component velocity fields in a highly three-dimensional vortical flow-the flow past a tab.

	Abstract = {We present a novel angle-resolved low coherence interferometry scheme for rapid measurement of depth-resolved angular scattering distributions to enable determination of scatterer size via elastic scattering properties. Depth resolution is achieved using a superluminescent diode in a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the mixed signal and reference fields dispersed by an imaging spectrograph. The spectrograph slit is located in a Fourier transform plane of the scattering sample, enabling angle-resolved measurements over a 0.21 radian range. The capabilities of the new technique are demonstrated by recording the distribution of light scattered by a sub-surface layer of polystyrene microspheres in 40 milliseconds. The data are used to determine the microsphere size with good accuracy. Future clinical application to measuring the size of cell nuclei in living epithelial tissues using backscattered light is discussed.},

@article{Rappaz2005,
	Abstract = {We have developed a digital holographic microscope (DHM), in a transmission mode, adapted to the quantitative study of cellular dynamics. Living cells in culture are optically probed by measuring the phase shift they produce on the transmitted wave front. The high temporal stability of the phase signal, equivalent to lambda/1800, and the low acquisition time (~20micros) enable to monitor cellular dynamics processes. An experimental procedure allowing to calculate both the integral refractive index and the cellular thickness (morphometry) from the measured phase shift is presented. Specifically, the method has been applied to study the dynamics of neurons in culture during a hypotonic stress. Such stress produces a paradoxical decrease of the phase which can be entirely resolved by applying the methodological approach described in this article; indeed the method allows to determine independently the thickness and the integral refractive index of cells.},

Light from a broadband source is filtered to an ~5 nm bandwidth and rapidly tuned across the visible spectrum in 1 nm increments by an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). Quantitative phase images of semitransparent samples are recovered at each wavelength using off-axis interferometry and are processed to recover relative and absolute dispersion measurements. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by (i) spectrally averaging phase images to reduce coherent noise, (ii) measuring absorptive and dispersive features in microspheres, and (iii) quantifying bulk hemoglobin concentrations by absolute refractive index measurements. Considerations of using low coherence illumination and the extension of spectral techniques in quantitative phase measurements are discussed.},

Those views are digitally manipulated in order to create the digital hologram. The method requires a simple setup and operates under white light illuminating conditions.

In this work we apply a compressive sensing approach to the multiple view projection holography acquisition process and demonstrate that the 3D scene can be accurately reconstructed from the highly subsampled generated Fourier hologram. It is also shown that the compressive sensing approach, combined with an appropriate system model, yields improved sectioning of the planes of different depths.},

Using the same method we also study the quality of their holographic recording on a highly efficient photopolymerizable glass. The proposed approach is useful for the creation of adaptive CGH that takes into account the peculiarities of the SLM, as well as for the quality control of the holographic data storage.},

@article{Sapet2006,
	Abstract = {Thrombin exerts pleiotropic effects on endothelial cells, including the release of microparticles (EMPs) that disseminate and exchange information with vascular cells. Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to their generation are not elucidated. We performed microarray analysis to identify genes involved in EMP release by the endothelial cell line HMEC-1 in response to thrombin. We identified a group of genes linked to the cytoskeleton reorganization family. Among these, the Rho-kinase ROCK-II presented a high transcription rate. ROCK-I, another Rho-kinase isoform, was not modulated by thrombin. Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho-kinases or specific depletion of ROCK-II by short interfering (si) RNA inhibited thrombin-induced EMP release. In contrast, ROCK-I mRNA silencing did not modify EMP generation by thrombin. Exposure of HMEC-1 to thrombin in presence of the caspase-2 selective inhibitor Z-VDVAD-FMK prevented ROCK-II cleavage and inhibited the thrombin-induced EMP release. These events were observed in absence of cell death. Our data clearly identified ROCK-II as a target of thrombin in EMP generation. They indicated that the 2 Rho-kinases did not share identical functions. The involvement of caspase-2 in ROCK-II activation independently of cell death points out a novel signaling pathway that emphasizes the proteolytic activity of caspase in EMP generation in response to cell activation.},

@article{Saraste2000,
	Abstract = {Apoptosis is characterised by a series of typical morphological features, such as shrinkage of the cell, fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies and rapid phagocytosis by neighbouring cells. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis as they relate to the morphologic hallmarks and their implications for the detection of apoptosis in cardiac tissue. Activation of cysteine proteases called caspases plays a major role in the execution of apoptosis. These proteases selectively cleave vital cellular substrates, which results in apoptotic morphology and internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA by selectively activated DNases. In response to several pro-apoptotic signals, mitochondria release caspase activating factors, that initiate an escalating caspase cascade and commit the cell to die. Members of the Bcl-2 oncoprotein family control mitochondrial events and are able to prevent, or induce, both apoptotic and non-apoptotic types of cell death. This suggests that different types of cell death share common mechanisms in the early phases, whereas activation of caspases determines the phenotype of cell death. Detection of apoptotic cells in tissue samples currently relies on the TUNEL assay. TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes show morphological features of apoptosis and the typical ladder pattern in DNA electrophoresis. Thus, provided that the staining protocol is carefully standardised, this quantitative methodology provides reproducible results of the occurrence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in cardiac samples. Recently, potentially more specific assays based on analysis of DNA fragmentation or demonstration of caspase activation have been developed. Applicability of these assays to demonstrate cardiomyocyte apoptosis should be tested.},

The cells are suspended in an index-matching absorbing buffer, where cell height is evaluated by measuring the difference in absorption between the cell and the background. Unlike interferometric microscopes, the measured cell height is nearly independent of the cell's optical properties. The height maps are captured using a single exposure of a color camera, and consequently the system is capable of high-throughput characterization of large collections of cells. Using this system, we have measured more than 1600 height maps and volumes of three different leukemia cell lines.},

Important physiological processes intimately related to the ability of the respective cells to migrate include embryogenesis, immune defense, angiogenesis, and wound healing. On the other side, migration is associated with life-threatening pathologies such as tumor metastases and atherosclerosis. Research from the last ? 15 years revealed that ion channels and transporters are indispensable components of the cellular migration apparatus. After presenting general principles by which transport proteins affect cell migration, we will discuss systematically the role of channels and transporters involved in cell migration.},

	Abstract = {Increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) is necessary for the dynamic membrane blebbing that is observed at the onset of apoptosis. Here we identify ROCK I, an effector of the small GTPase Rho, as a new substrate for caspases. ROCK I is cleaved by caspase-3 at a conserved DETD1113/G sequence and its carboxy-terminal inhibitory domain is removed, resulting in deregulated and constitutive kinase activity. ROCK proteins are known to regulate MLC-phosphorylation, and apoptotic cells exhibit a gradual increase in levels of phosphorylated MLC concomitant with ROCK I cleavage. This phosphorylation, as well as membrane blebbing, is abrogated by inhibition of caspases or ROCK proteins, but both processes are independent of Rho activity. We also show that expression of active truncated ROCK I induces cell blebbing. Thus, activation of ROCK I by caspase-3 seems to be responsible for bleb formation in apoptotic cells.},

	Abstract = {Caspase activation in target cells is a major function of granzyme B (grB) during cytotoxic lymphocyte granule-induced apoptosis. grB-mediated cell death can occur in the absence of active caspases, and the molecular targets responsible for this additional pathway remain poorly defined. Apoptotic plasma membrane blebbing is caspase independent during granule exocytosis-mediated cell death, whereas in other instances, this event is a consequence of the cleavage by caspases of the Rho effector, Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) I. We show here that grB directly cleaves ROCK II, a ROCK family member encoded by a separate gene and closely related to ROCK I, and this causes constitutive kinase activity and bleb formation. For the first time, two proteins of the same family are found to be specifically cleaved by either a caspase or grB, thus defining two independent pathways with similar phenotypic consequences in the cells. During granule-induced cell death, ROCK II cleavage by grB would overcome, for this apoptotic feature, the consequences of deficient caspase activation that may occur in virus-infected or malignant target cells.},

	Abstract = {Thick mask electromagnetic edge effects in attenuating phase-shift masks (ATT-PSM) are analyzed by extracting optical phase at the wafer plane from a series of through focus aerial images with 193nm light. The thick edges of an ATT-PSM can lead to phase distortions, creating asymmetric intensity contrast on either side of focus. Here we use through focus intensity images from an AIMS tool to quantitatively recover phase via the Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE). The TIE can recover the effective phase across the mask due to edge effects by analyzing the through focus image stack. We verify a previously proposed model for edge effects by adding quadrature phase boundary layers at the edges during simulation and compare the simulated through focus images with experimental data. After tuning the real and imaginary part of the boundary layer and the angle of the substrate, the simulated through focus behavior agrees with experiment, giving a measure of the edge effects. This leads to comparable quantitative phase profiles recovered at the wafer plane for simulation and experiment with the ATT-PSM. We expect that the method is applicable for the approximation of topographical effects in other types of thick masks as well.},

Both fertilized and unfertilized eggs obey the Boyle-van't-Hoff law, but the value for b, the "osmotically inactive fraction" or non-swellable volume, was different for the two, averaging in the cases studied 7.3 per cent for unfertilized and 27.4 per cent for fertilized. 3. On activation, the eggs of the sea urchin undergo a definite increase in total cell volume, of approximately 2.7 per cent. 4. Some evidence is adduced for the possibility that the alteration in cell volume and in o.i.f. may depend upon the species in question. 5. A parallelism between change in b and alteration of respiratory metabolism in Arbacia, Chaetopterus, and Arbacia fragments is pointed out. This requires further investigation in other species to establish generality. 6.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that sub-wavelength optical images borne on partially-spatially-incoherent light can be recovered, from their far-field or from the blurred image, given the prior knowledge that the image is sparse, and only that. The reconstruction method relies on the recently demonstrated sparsity-based sub-wavelength imaging. However, for partially-spatially-incoherent light, the relation between the measurements and the image is quadratic, yielding non-convex measurement equations that do not conform to previously used techniques. Consequently, we demonstrate new algorithmic methodology, referred to as quadratic compressed sensing, which can be applied to a range of other problems involving information recovery from partial correlation measurements, including when the correlation function has local dependencies. Specifically for microscopy, this method can be readily extended to white light microscopes with the additional knowledge of the light source spectrum.},

@article{Shepherd2006,
	Abstract = {Water was called by Szent-Gyorgi "life's mater and matrix, mother and medium." This chapter considers both aspects of his statement. Many astrobiologists argue that some, if not all, of Earth's water arrived during cometary bombardments. Amorphous water ices of comets possibly facilitated organization of complex organic molecules, kick-starting prebiotic evolution. In Gaian theory, Earth retains its water as a consequence of biological activity. The cell cytomatrix is a proteinaceous matrix/lattice incorporating the cytoskeleton, a pervasive, holistic superstructural network that integrates metabolic pathways. Enzymes of metabolic pathways are ordered in supramolecular clusters (metabolons) associated with cytoskeleton and/or membranes. Metabolic intermediates are microchanneled through metabolons without entering a bulk aqueous phase. Rather than being free in solution, even major signaling ions are probably clustered in association with the cytomatrix. Chloroplasts and mitochondria, like bacteria and archaea, also contain a cytoskeletal lattice, metabolons, and channel metabolites. Eukaryotic metabolism is mathematically a scale-free or small-world network. Enzyme clusters of bacterial origin are incorporated at a pathway level that is architecturally archaean. The eucaryotic cell may be a product of serial endosymbiosis, a chimera. Cell cytoplasm is approximately 80\% water. Water is indisputably a conserved structural element of proteins, essential to their folding, specificity, ligand binding, and to enzyme catalysis. The vast literature of organized cell water has long argued that the cytomatrix and cell water are an entire system, a continuum, or gestalt. Alternatives are offered to mainstream explanations of cell electric potentials, ion channel, enzyme, and motor protein function, in terms of high-order cooperative systems of ions, water, and macromolecules. This chapter describes some prominent concepts of organized cell water, including vicinal water network theory, the association-induction hypothesis, wave-cluster theory, phase-gel transition theories, and theories of low- and high-density water polymorphs.},

	Abstract = {Large blebs form rapidly on apical membranes of sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) when the organ of Corti is freshly isolated from adult guinea pigs. Bleb formation had two distinguishable phases. Initially, we identified small particles labeled with fluorescent annexin V; these rapidly coalesced into larger aggregates. After particle aggregation, a single membrane bleb emerged from cuticular plate at the vestigial kinocilium location, eventually reaching approximately 10 microm maximum spherical diameter; blebs this size often detached from IHCs. Development of blebs was associated with elevated concentration of intracellular Na(+); blocking Na(+) influx through mechanotransduction and ATP channels in the apical pole of IHCs or by replacement of Na(+) with N-methyl-D-glucamine prevented Na(+) loading and bleb formation. Depletion of intracellular ATP, blocking cAMP synthesis, inhibition of vesicular transport with brefeldin A, or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one (LY-294002) significantly reduced bleb formation in the presence of a Na(+) load. Neither the mechanism of blebbing nor the size growth of the IHC blebs was associated with cellular apoptosis or necrosis. Bleb formation was not significantly reduced by disassembling microtubules or decreasing intracellular hydrostatic pressure. Moreover, no polymerized actin was observed in the lumen of blebs. We conclude that IHC bleb formation differs from classic blebbing mechanisms and that IHC blebs arise from imbalance of endocytosis and exocytosis in the apical plasma membrane, linked to Na(+) loading that occurs in vitro.},

In many applications, a boundary-enhanced image is sought that reveals the locations of discontinuities in the real-valued component of the refractive index distribution. We investigate two iterative algorithms for few-view image reconstruction in boundary-enhanced PCT that exploit the fact that a boundary-enhanced PCT image, or its gradient, is often sparse. In order to exploit object sparseness, the reconstruction algorithms seek to minimize the $\ell$1-norm or TV-norm of the image, subject to data consistency constraints. We demonstrate that the algorithms can reconstruct accurate boundary-enhanced images from highly incomplete few-view projection data.},

	Abstract = {This work is concerned with applying iterative image reconstruction, based on constrained total-variation minimization, to low-intensity X-ray CT systems that have a high sampling rate. Such systems pose a challenge for iterative image reconstruction, because a very fine image grid is needed to realize the resolution inherent in such scanners. These image arrays lead to under-determined imaging models whose inversion is unstable and can result in undesirable artifacts and noise patterns. There are many possibilities to stabilize the imaging model, and this work proposes a method which may have an advantage in terms of algorithm efficiency. The proposed method introduces additional constraints in the optimization problem; these constraints set to zero high spatial frequency components which are beyond the sensing capability of the detector. The method is demonstrated with an actual CT data set and compared with another method based on projection up-sampling.},

We propose a new numerical reconstruction approach using a statistical technique. This approach reconstructs the complex field of the object from the real-valued hologram intensity data. Because holographic image reconstruction is an ill-posed problem, our statistical technique is based on penalized-likelihood estimation. We develop a Poisson statistical model for this problem and derive an optimization transfer algorithm that monotonically decreases the cost function at each iteration. Simulation results show that our statistical technique has the potential to improve image quality in digital holography relative to conventional reconstruction techniques.},

Most conventional digital holography methods are based on Fresnel transform and present several problems such as twin-image noise, border effects, and other effects. To avoid these difficulties, we propose an inverse-problem approach, which yields the optimal particle set that best models the observed hologram image. We resolve this global optimization problem by conventional particle detection followed by a local refinement for each particle. Results for both simulated and real digital holograms show strong improvement in the localization of the particles, particularly along the depth dimension. In our simulations, the position precision is $\geq$1 $\mu$m rms. Our results also show that the localization precision does not deteriorate for particles near the edge of the field of view.},

To determine the relationship between pHi and the disruption of cytoplasmic organization, we examined the effects of altering pHi on hamster embryo development, mitochondrial distribution, and cytoskeletal organization. The weak base trimethylamine was used to increase pHi and was found to reduce embryo development and disrupt the perinuclear organization of mitochondria. The weak acid 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolinedione was used to decrease pH(i) and was also found to reduce development and disrupt the perinuclear organization of mitochondria. With either treatment, the microfilament organization was perturbed, but the microtubule cytoskeleton was not. However, the temporal progression of the disruption of mitochondrial distribution was more rapid in alkalinized embryos than acidified embryos, as revealed by two-photon imaging of living embryos. Additionally, the disruption of the microfilament network by the two treatments was not identical. The cytoplasmic disruptions observed were not due to acute toxicity of the compounds because embryos recovered developmentally when the treatment compounds were removed. These observations link ionic homeostasis, structural integrity and developmental competence in preimplantation hamster embryos.},

@article{Stewart2011,
	Abstract = {During mitosis, adherent animal cells undergo a drastic shape change, from essentially flat to round. Mitotic cell rounding is thought to facilitate organization within the mitotic cell and be necessary for the geometric requirements of division. However, the forces that drive this shape change remain poorly understood in the presence of external impediments, such as a tissue environment. Here we use cantilevers to track cell rounding force and volume. We show that cells have an outward rounding force, which increases as cells enter mitosis. We find that this mitotic rounding force depends both on the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the cells' ability to regulate osmolarity. The rounding force itself is generated by an osmotic pressure. However, the actomyosin cortex is required to maintain this rounding force against external impediments. Instantaneous disruption of the actomyosin cortex leads to volume increase, and stimulation of actomyosin contraction leads to volume decrease. These results show that in cells, osmotic pressure is balanced by inwardly directed actomyosin cortex contraction. Thus, by locally modulating actomyosin-cortex-dependent surface tension and globally regulating osmotic pressure, cells can control their volume, shape and mechanical properties.},

Using a heterodyne Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we record complex field images of light transmitted through a sample with varying directions of illumination. To quantitatively reconstruct the 3D map of complex refractive index in live cells, we apply optical diffraction tomography based on the Rytov approximation. In this way, the effect of diffraction is taken into account in the reconstruction process and diffraction-free high resolution 3D images are obtained throughout the entire sample volume. The quantitative refractive index map can potentially serve as an intrinsic assay to provide the molecular concentrations without the addition of exogenous agents and also to provide a method for studying the light scattering properties of single cells.},

	Abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) allows tomographic (3D), non-invasive reconstructions of tissue optical properties for biomedical applications. Severe under-sampling is a common problem in DOT which leads to image artifacts. A large number of measurements is needed in order to minimize these artifacts. In this work, we introduce a compressed sensing (CS) framework for DOT which enables improved reconstructions with under-sampled data. The CS framework uses a sparsifying basis, $\ell$1-regularization and random sampling to reduce the number of measurements that are needed to achieve a certain accuracy. We demonstrate the utility of the CS framework using numerical simulations. The CS results show improved DOT results in comparison to ``traditional'' linear reconstruction methods based on singular-value decomposition (SVD) with $\ell$2-regularization and with regular and random sampling. Furthermore, CS is shown to be more robust against the reduction of measurements in comparison to the other methods. Potential benefits and shortcomings of the CS approach in the context of DOT are discussed.},

@article{TASSIN:1995xn,
	Abstract = {A non-intrusive measuring technique based on video-imaging has been developed for the measurement of bubble size, velocity and frequency. Measurements carried out with this method have been compared to those obtained by an optimized phase-Doppler system in standard configuration, for a wide range of bubble sizes produced from single injectors in a quiescent environment. The two measuring techniques have yielded velocities and frequencies that are in very good agreement while the size of spherical bubbles was consistently measured by both methods. The phase-Doppler system was also used to size oblate-spheroidal bubbles moving with their equatorial plane parallel to the scattering plane, yielding measurements reasonably close to the average radius of curvature of the bubbles in the neighborhood of the equatorial plane, as calculated from the video-imaging data. Both methods were used for detailed velocity measurements of the bubble-stream in the neighborhood of the injector tip. The observed bubble-velocity variation with the distance from the injector tip does not always display the usual increasing trend leading into the terminal velocity. When injection conditions are near the transition from discrete to jet injection mode and the bubbles are small, the latter decelerate into a terminal velocity due to direct interaction of successive bubbles at the injector tip. The measured terminal velocities of bubble-chains for a variety of bubble sizes and injection frequencies, are successfully predicted by using a far-field wake approximation to account for the drafting effect which is responsible for bubble-chain velocities higher than those of single bubbles.},

	Abstract = {Phase space tomography estimates correlation functions entirely from snapshots in the evolution of the wave function along a time or space variable. In contrast, traditional interferometric methods require measurement of multiple two--point correlations. However, as in every tomographic formulation, undersampling poses a severe limitation. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, experimental demonstration of compressive reconstruction of the classical optical correlation function, i.e. the mutual intensity function. Our compressive algorithm makes explicit use of the physically justifiable assumption of a low--entropy source (or state.) Since the source was directly accessible in our classical experiment, we were able to compare the compressive estimate of the mutual intensity to an independent ground--truth estimate from the van Cittert--Zernike theorem and verify substantial quantitative improvements in the reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {Fourier Ptychography is a new computational microscopy technique that achieves gigapixel images with both wide field of view and high resolution in both phase and amplitude. The hardware setup involves a simple replacement of the microscope\&\#x02019;s illumination unit with a programmable LED array, allowing one to flexibly pattern illumination angles without any moving parts. In previous work, a series of low-resolution images was taken by sequentially turning on each single LED in the array, and the data were then combined to recover a bandwidth much higher than the one allowed by the original imaging system. Here, we demonstrate a multiplexed illumination strategy in which multiple randomly selected LEDs are turned on for each image. Since each LED corresponds to a different area of Fourier space, the total number of images can be significantly reduced, without sacrificing image quality. We demonstrate this method experimentally in a modified commercial microscope. Compared to sequential scanning, our multiplexed strategy achieves similar results with approximately an order of magnitude reduction in both acquisition time and data capture requirements.},

@article{Tinevez2009,
	Abstract = {Blebs are spherical membrane protrusions often observed during cell migration, cell spreading, cytokinesis, and apoptosis, both in cultured cells and in vivo. Bleb expansion is thought to be driven by the contractile actomyosin cortex, which generates hydrostatic pressure in the cytoplasm and can thus drive herniations of the plasma membrane. However, the role of cortical tension in bleb formation has not been directly tested, and despite the importance of blebbing, little is known about the mechanisms of bleb growth. In order to explore the link between cortical tension and bleb expansion, we induced bleb formation on cells with different tensions. Blebs were nucleated in a controlled manner by laser ablation of the cortex, mimicking endogenous bleb nucleation. Cortical tension was modified by treatments affecting the level of myosin activity or proteins regulating actin turnover. We show that there is a critical tension below which blebs cannot expand. Above this threshold, the maximal size of a bleb strongly depends on tension, and this dependence can be fitted with a model of the cortex as an active elastic material. Together, our observations and model allow us to relate bleb shape parameters to the underlying cellular mechanics and provide insights as to how bleb formation can be biochemically regulated during cell motility.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative models describing the dynamics of human neutrophils in the microcirculation require accurate morphometric parameters such as volume and surface membrane area. Using both a micropipette technique and video light microscopy (LM) to measure the diameters of the spherical cells, we have accurately determined the volume of the human neutrophil. Our value, 299 +/- 32 microns 3, is in good agreement with our earlier results, but 55\% larger than that reported by Schmid-Sch?nbein et al (Blood 56:866, 1980). However, the measurements of Schmid-Sch?nbein et al were based on the actual mass of the cells derived from transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images. The membrane surface area, at lysis, was calculated to be 2.6 times its initial projected area. After lysis, the cells do not reduce their size, indicative of the possibility of a F-actin network formation that would stiffen the structure. Further, we show that neutrophils behave as ideal osmometers when exposed to anisotonic solutions at 21 degrees C, as predicted by the Boyle-Van't Hoff relationship. The calculated Ponder's value, R, is 0.77, which corresponds to 77\% of the cell volume being osmotically active under isotonic conditions. However, at 37 degrees C, the cells are able to regulate their volumes toward the original volumes after an osmotic stress.},

	Abstract = {Basic studies of projection printed images are presented to identify the types of patterns which are most susceptible to residual aberrations and to establish test structures which may be used to monitor the presence of critical types of residuals. These effects are explored by including arbitrary lens optical path difference (OPD) aberration functions in a two-dimensional optical image simulation program associated with SAMPLE. The lens aberration function is expressed either in Zernike polynomials or a series expansion. The intensity is calculated from Hopkin's transmission cross-coefficient formula-tion with a self-checking algorithm. A catalog of results is presented here for the dominant primary aberrations of coma and astigmatism for a fixed maximum OPD of 0.4 ??. Contact holes are shown to be much more susceptible to astigmatism than coma and the traditional checkerboard test pattern is verified as a sensitive diagnostic pattern. An alternative structure con-sisting of thin lines with a short break is shown to be even more sensitive to astigmatism and useful for distinguishing it from coma. A further improvement in sensitivity is obtained through the use of small nonprintable defect-like features in proximity to regular features which coherently interact with the blurred image of the feature. A test target of this type is recommended for monitoring coma.},

	Abstract = {Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane water channels that are involved in a diverse set of functions in mammalian physiology including epithelial fluid transport, brain water balance, cell migration, cell proliferation, neuroexcitation, fat metabolism, epidermal hydration, and others. Phenotype analysis of knockout mice has demonstrated an important role for AQPs in transepithelial fluid transport in kidney tubules, salivary and airway submucosal glands, choroid plexus and ciliary epithelium. The physiological functions of these epithelia, such as absorption of glomerular filtrate by proximal tubule and secretion of saliva by salivary gland, involve rapid transcellular water transport across epithelial cell barriers. Studies in knockout mice have also provided evidence that AQPs are not physiologically important in some epithelia where they are expressed, including lacrimal gland, sweat gland, gallbladder, alveoli and airways. Rates of transepithelial fluid transport per unit membrane surface area in these epithelia are substantially lower than transepithelial fluid transport rates in proximal tubule and salivary gland. Pharmacological inhibition of AQP water permeability in epithelia, with consequent reduced fluid transport, offers potential therapy for human diseases involving water imbalance such as congestive heart failure, hypertension and glaucoma.},

In this article, we briefly consider the fundamentals and methodological aspects of the coherent phase microscopy (CPM). One of important advantages of this method is a high sensitivity of CPM images to changes in physical-chemical properties of biological samples. The optical path length difference (OPLD), measured with CPM instruments in different domains of an object, serves as the informative optical parameter used for visualization of individual cells or intracellular organelles. Metabolically dependent variations of CPM images reflect changes in the functional state of biological objects. In the next article, we review results of CPM studies of different cells and intracellular energy-transducing organelles.},

	Abstract = {Chloride movement across cell plasma and internal membranes, is of central importance for regulation of cell volume and pH, vectorial salt movement in epithelia, and, probably, intracellular traffic. Quinolinium-based chloride-sensitive fluorescent indicators provide a new approach to study chloride transport mechanisms and regulation that is complementary to 36Cl tracer methods, intracellular microelectrodes, and patch clamp. Indicator fluorescence is quenched by chloride by a collisional mechanism with Stern-Volmer constants of up to 220 M-1. Fluorescence is quenched selectively by chloride in physiological systems and responds to changes in chloride concentration in under 1 ms. The indicators are nontoxic and can be loaded into living cells for continuous measurement of intracellular chloride concentration by single-cell fluorescence microscopy. In this review, the structure-activity relationships for chloride-sensitive fluorescent indicators are described. Methodology for measurement of chloride transport in isolated vesicle and liposome systems and in intact cells is evaluated critically by use of examples from epithelial cell physiology. Future directions for synthesis of tailored chloride-sensitive indicators and new applications of indicators for studies of transport regulation and intracellular ion gradients are proposed.},

@article{Vu2001,
	Abstract = {Caspase activation and apoptotic volume decrease are fundamental features of programmed cell death; however, the relationship between these components is not well understood. Here we provide biochemical and genetic evidence for the differential involvement of initiator caspases in the apoptotic volume decrease during both intrinsic and extrinsic activation of apoptosis. Apoptosis induction in Jurkat T lymphocytes by Fas receptor engagement (intrinsic) or ultraviolet (UV)-C radiation (extrinsic) triggered the loss of cell volume, which was restricted to cells with diminished intracellular K(+) ions. These characteristics kinetically coincided with the proteolytic processing and activation of both initiator and effector caspases. Although the polycaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone completely inhibited the Fas-mediated apoptotic volume decrease and K(+) efflux, it was much less effective in preventing these processes during UV-induced cell death under conditions whereby caspase activities and DNA degradation were blocked. To define the roles of specific initiator caspases, we utilized Jurkat cells genetically deficient in caspase-8 or stably transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of caspase-9. The results show that the activation of caspase-8, but not caspase-9, is necessary for Fas-induced apoptosis. Conversely, caspase-9, but not caspase-8, is important for UV-mediated shrunken morphology and apoptosis progression. Together, these findings indicate that cell shrinkage and K(+) efflux during apoptosis are tightly coupled, but are differentially regulated by either caspase-8 or caspase-9 depending on specific pathways of cell death.},

	Abstract = {We present spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) as a new optical microscopy technique, capable of measuring nanoscale structures and dynamics in live cells via interferometry. SLIM combines two classic ideas in light imaging: Zernike\&amp;\#x2019;s phase contrast microscopy, which renders high contrast intensity images of transparent specimens, and Gabor\&amp;\#x2019;s holography, where the phase information from the object is recorded. Thus, SLIM reveals the intrinsic contrast of cell structures and, in addition, renders quantitative optical path-length maps across the sample. The resulting topographic accuracy is comparable to that of atomic force microscopy, while the acquisition speed is 1,000 times higher. We illustrate the novel insight into cell dynamics via SLIM by experiments on primary cell cultures from the rat brain. SLIM is implemented as an add-on module to an existing phase contrast microscope, which may prove instrumental in impacting the light microscopy field at a large scale.},

	Abstract = {The Na+, K+-ATPase (Na+, K+-pump) plays critical roles in maintaining ion homeostasis. Blocking the Na+, K+-pump may lead to apoptosis. By contrast, whether an apoptotic insult may affect the Na+, K+-pump activity is largely undefined. In cultured cortical neurons, the Na+, K+-pump activity measured as a membrane current Ipump was time-dependently suppressed by apoptotic insults including serum deprivation, staurosporine, and C2-ceramide, concomitant with depletion of intracellular ATP and production of reactive oxygen species. Signifying a putative relationship among these events, Ipump was highly sensitive to changes in ATP and reactive oxygen species levels. Moreover, the apoptosis-associated Na+, K+-pump failure and serum deprivation-induced neuronal death were antagonized by pyruvate and succinate in ATP- and reactive-oxygen-species-dependent manners. We suggest that failure of the Na+, K+-pump as a result of a combination of energy deficiency and production of reactive oxygen species is a common event in the apoptotic cascade; preserving the pump activity provides a neuroprotective strategy in certain pathological conditions.},

	Abstract = {We study Wigner phase-space distributions W(x, p) in position (x) and momentum (p) for light undergoing multiple small-angle scattering in a turbid medium. Smoothed Wigner phase-space distributions are measured by using a heterodyne technique that achieves position and momentum resolution determined by the width and the diffraction angle of the local oscillator beam. The sample consists of 5.7-$\mu$m-radius polystyrene spheres suspended in a water--glycerol mixture. The momentum distribution of the transmitted light is found to contain a ballistic peak, a narrow diffractive pedestal, and a broad background. The narrow diffractive pedestal is found to decay more slowly than the ballistic peak as the concentration of scatterers is increased. The data are in excellent agreement with a simple theoretical model that explains the behavior of the narrow pedestal by including multiple diffractive scattering and treating large-angle scattering as a loss.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, it has become evident that the volume of a given cell is an important factor not only in defining its intracellular osmolality and its shape, but also in defining other cellular functions, such as transepithelial transport, cell migration, cell growth, cell death, and the regulation of intracellular metabolism. In addition, besides inorganic osmolytes, the existence of organic osmolytes in cells has been discovered. Osmolyte transport systems-channels and carriers alike-have been identified and characterized at a molecular level and also, to a certain extent, the intracellular signals regulating osmolyte movements across the plasma membrane. The current review reflects these developments and focuses on the contributions of inorganic and organic osmolytes and their transport systems in regulatory volume increase (RVI) and regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in a variety of cells. Furthermore, the current knowledge on signal transduction in volume regulation is compiled, revealing an astonishing diversity in transport systems, as well as of regulatory signals. The information available indicates the existence of intricate spatial and temporal networks that control cell volume and that we are just beginning to be able to investigate and to understand.},

	Abstract = {K+ and Cl- homeostasis have been implicated in cell volume regulation and apoptosis. We addressed the hypothesis that K+ and Cl- efflux may contribute to apoptotic cell shrinkage and apoptotic death in cultured cortical neurons. CLC-2 and CLC-3 chloride channels were detected in cultured cortical neurons. The Cl- channel blockers 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB) inhibited the outwardly rectifying Cl- current, prevented apoptotic cell shrinkage, and mildly attenuated cell death induced by staurosporine, C2-ceramide, or serum deprivation. Cl- channel blockers, however, at concentrations that prevented cell shrinkage had no significant effects on caspase activation and/or DNA fragmentation. Cell death in the presence of a Cl- channel blocker was still sensitive to blockade by the caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk). Electron microscopy revealed that, although DIDS prevented apoptotic cell shrinkage, certain apoptotic ultrastructural alterations still took place in injured neurons. On the other hand, the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), clofilium, or the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevented cell shrinkage as well as caspase activation and/or DNA damage, and showed stronger neuroprotection against apoptotic alterations and cell death. The results indicate that neurons may undergo apoptotic process without cell shrinkage and imply distinct roles for Cl- and K+ homeostasis in regulating different apoptotic events.},

Fourier domain detection methods enable more than an order of magnitude increase in imaging speed and sensitivity, thus overcoming the sensitivity limitations inherent in ultrahigh-resolution OCT using standard time domain detection. Fourier domain methods also provide direct access to the spectrum of the optical signal. This enables automatic numerical dispersion compensation, a key factor in achieving ultrahigh image resolutions. We present ultrahigh-resolution, high-speed Fourier domain OCT imaging with an axial resolution of 2.1 \`{i}m in tissue and 16,000 axial scans per second at 1024 pixels per axial scan. Ultrahigh-resolution spectral domain OCT is shown to provide a ~100x increase in imaging speed when compared to ultrahigh-resolution time domain OCT. In vivo imaging of the human retina is demonstrated. We also present a general technique for automatic numerical dispersion compensation, which is applicable to spectral domain as well as swept source embodiments of Fourier domain OCT.},

Making use of this result, a statistical ensemble of strictly monochromatic oscillations, all of the same temporal frequency, is then introduced that yields the cross-spectral density as a correlation function in the space-frequency domain. From these results two new expressions for the Wiener-Khintchine spectrum of the source and also a new mode representation of the cross-correlation function of the source follow at once.},

	Abstract = {We investigate a general form of the Wigner function for wave fields that satisfy the Helmholtz equation in two-dimensional free space. The momentum moment of this Wigner function is shown to correspond to the flux of the wave field. For a forward-propagating wave field, the negative regions of the Wigner function are seen to be associated with small regions of backward flux in the field. We also study different projections of the Wigner function, each corresponding to a distribution in a reduced phase space that fully characterizes the wave field. One of these projections is the standard Wigner function of the field at a screen. Another projection introduced by us has the added property of being conserved along rays and is better suited to the description of nonparaxial wave fields.},

	Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) time-domain imaging is an emerging modality and has attracted a lot of interest. However, existing THz imaging systems often require a long scan time and sophisticated system design. Recently, a new design incorporating compressed sensing (CS) leads to a lower detector cost and shorter scan time, in exchange for computation in an image reconstruction step. In this paper, we develop two reconstruction algorithms that can estimate the underlying scene as accurately as possible. First is a single-band CS reconstruction method, where we show that by making use of prior information about the phase and the correlation between the spatial distributions of the amplitude and phase, the reconstruction quality can be significantly improved over previously published methods. Second, we develop a method that uses the multi-frequency nature of the THz pulse. Through effective use of the spatial sparsity, spectroscopic phase information, and correlations across the hyperspectral bands, our method can further enhance the recovered image quality. This is demonstrated by computation on a set of experimental THz data captured in a single-pixel THz system.},

	Abstract = {Aerial image through focus in the presence of aberrations and electromagnetic edge effects modeled by adding \&\#xB1;\&\#x3C0;/2 phase at pattern edges is expanded by a quadratic equation with respect to focus. The quadratic equation is expressed by four coefficients that are adequately independent of both mask layout and the variations in the optical setting in projection printing, thus saving the computation cost of the quadratic fit for each individual layout edge position in a new mask pattern or variation from a nominal optical setting. The error of this method is less than 1\% for any typical integrated circuit features. This accuracy holds when the defocus is less than one Rayleigh unit (0.5\&\#x3BB;/NA2, where \&\#x3BB; is a wavelength and NA is the numerical aperture) and the root mean square of the existing aberration is less than 0.02\&\#x3BB;, which encompasses current lithography practice. More importantly, the method is a foundation for future first-cut accurate algebraic imaging models that have sufficient speed for assessing the desired or undesired changes in the through-focus images of millions of features as the optical system conditions change. These optical system changes occur naturally across the image field, and aberration levels are even programmed in tuning modern tooling to compensate for electromagnetic mask edge effects.},

The technique is based on measuring the phase difference between the fundamental and the second-harmonic light in a novel interferometer. PDM is highly sensitive to subtle refractive-index differences that are due to dispersion (differential optical path sensitivity, 5 nm). We apply PDM to measure minute amounts of DNA in solution and to study biological tissue sections. We demonstrate that PDM performs better than conventional phase-contrast microscopy in imaging dispersive and weakly scattering samples.},

The technique simultaneously probes the target with fundamental and second-harmonic light and interferometrically measures the relative phase shift of the backscattered light fields. This phase change can arise either from reflection at an interface within a sample or from bulk refraction. We show that this highly sensitive (~5{\textdegree}) phase technique can complement optical coherence tomography, which measures electric field amplitude, by revealing otherwise undetectable dispersive variations in the sample.},

It uses the fact that the CC is maximum at the focal plane. The factors influencing this method are discussed with a numerical simulation of holograms. For real holograms, the Wiener filter was proposed to process both recorded holograms and reconstructed images. The application results using the dot array target showed that the Wiener filter is a very effective tool for processing holography-related images. The effects of the dot size and the object distance on the errors in the determination of the focal plane by the CC method were investigated by using the calibration target.},

@article{Yu2003,
	Abstract = {The Na(+), K(+)-ATPase is a ubiquitous membrane transport protein in mammalian cells, responsible for establishing and maintaining high K(+) and low Na(+) in the cytoplasm required for normal resting membrane potentials and various cellular activities. The ionic homeostasis maintained by the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase is also critical for cell growth, differentiation, and cell survival. Although the toxic effects of blocking the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase by ouabain and other selective inhibitors have been known for years, the mechanism of action remained unclear. Recent progress in two areas has significantly advanced our understanding of the role and mechanism of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase in cell death. Along with increased recognition of apoptosis in a wide range of disease states, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase deficiency has been identified as a contributor to apoptosis and pathogenesis. More importantly, accumulating evidence now endorses a close relationship between ionic homeostasis and apoptosis, namely the regulation of apoptosis by K(+) homeostasis. Since Na(+), K(+)-ATPase is the primary system for K(+) uptake, dysfunction of the transport enzyme and resultant disruption of ionic homeostasis have been re-evaluated for their critical roles in apoptosis and apoptosis-related diseases. In this review, instead of giving a detailed description of the structure and regulation of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, the author will focus on the most recent evidence indicating the unique role of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase in cell death, including apoptosis and the newly recognized "hybrid death" of concurrent apoptosis and necrosis in the same cells. It is also hoped that discussion of some seemingly conflicting reports will inspire further debate and benefit future investigation in this important research field.},

	Abstract = {Staurosporine (STS) and etoposide (Eto) induced apoptosis of the human histiocytic lymphoma cells U937 were studied to determine the role of monovalent ions in apoptotic cell shrinkage. Cell shrinkage, defined as cell dehydration, was assayed by measurement of buoyant density of cells in continuous Percoll gradient. The K+ and Na+ content in cells of different density fractions was estimated by flame emission analysis. Apoptosis was evaluated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry of acridine orange stained cells, by flow DNA cytometry and by effector caspase activity. Apoptosis of U937 cells induced by 1 muM STS for 4 h was found to be paralleled by an increase in buoyant density indicating cell shrinkage. An increase in density was accompanied by a decrease in K+ content (from 1.1 to 0.78 mmol/g protein), which exceeded the increase in Na+ content (from 0.30 to 0.34 mmol/g) and resulted in a significant decrease of the total K+ and Na+ content (from 1.4 to 1.1 mmol/g). In contrast to STS, 50 microM Eto for 4 h or 0.8-8 microM Eto for 18-24 h induced apoptosis without triggering cell shrinkage. During apoptosis of U937 cells induced by Eto the intracellular K(+)/Na+ ratio decreased like in the cells treated with STS, but the total K+ and Na+ content remained virtually the same due to a decrease in K+ content being nearly the same as an increase in Na+ content. Apoptotic cell dehydration correlated with the shift of the total cellular K+ and Na+ content. There was no statistically significant decrease in K+ concentration per cell water during apoptosis induced by either Eto (by 13.5\%) or STS (by 8\%), whereas increase in Na+ concentration per cell water was statistically significant (by 27\% and 47\%, respectively). The data show that apoptosis can occur without cell shrinkage-dehydration, that apoptosis with shrinkage is mostly due to a decrease in cellular K+ content, and that this decrease is not accompanied by a significant decrease of K+ concentration in cell water.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a method for measurement of plasma membrane water permeability (P(f)) in intact cells using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The method is based on confocal recording of the fluorescence intensity emitted by calcein-loaded adherent cells during osmotic shock. P(f) is calculated as a function of the time constant in the fluorescence intensity change, the cell surface-to-volume ratio and the fractional content of the osmotically active cell volume. The method has been applied to the measurement of water permeability in MDCK cells. The cells behaved as linear osmometers in the interval from 100 to 350 mosM. About 57\% of the total cell volume was found to be osmotically inactive. Water movement across the plasma membrane in intact MDCK cells was highly temperature dependent. HgCl2 had no effect on water permeability, while amphotericin B and DMSO significantly increased P(f) values. The water permeability in MDCK cells transfected with aquaporin 2 was an order of magnitude higher than in the intact MDCK cell line. The water permeability of the nuclear membrane in both cell lines was found to be unlimited. Thus the intranuclear fluid belongs to the osmotically active portion of the cell. We conclude that the use of confocal microscopy provides a sensitive and reproducible method for measurement of water permeability in different types of adherent cells and potentially for coverslip-attached tissue preparations.},

@article{Zhu2011,
	Abstract = {We demonstrate wide-field fluorescent and darkfield imaging on a cell-phone with compact{,} light-weight and cost-effective optical components that are mechanically attached to the existing camera unit of the cell-phone. For this purpose{,} we used battery powered light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to pump the sample of interest from the side using butt-coupling{,} where the pump light was guided within the sample cuvette to uniformly excite the specimen. The fluorescent emission from the sample was then imaged using an additional lens that was positioned right in front of the existing lens of the cell-phone camera. Because the excitation occurs through guided waves that propagate perpendicular to our detection path{,} an inexpensive plastic colour filter was sufficient to create the dark-field background required for fluorescent imaging{,} without the need for a thin-film interference filter. We validate the performance of this platform by imaging various fluorescent micro-objects in 2 colours (i.e.{,} red and green) over a large field-of-view (FOV) of [similar]81 mm2 with a raw spatial resolution of [similar]20 [small mu ]m. With additional digital processing of the captured cell-phone images{,} through the use of compressive sampling theory{,} we demonstrate [similar]2 fold improvement in our resolving power{,} achieving [similar]10 [small mu ]m resolution without a trade-off in our FOV. Further{,} we also demonstrate darkfield imaging of non-fluorescent specimen using the same interface{,} where this time the scattered light from the objects is detected without the use of any filters. The capability of imaging a wide FOV would be exceedingly important to probe large sample volumes (e.g.{,} >0.1 mL) of e.g.{,} blood{,} urine{,} sputum or water{,} and for this end we also demonstrate fluorescent imaging of labeled white-blood cells from whole blood samples{,} as well as water-borne pathogenic protozoan parasites such as Giardia Lamblia cysts. Weighing only [similar]28 g ([similar]1 ounce){,} this compact and cost-effective fluorescent imaging platform attached to a cell-phone could be quite useful especially for resource-limited settings{,} and might provide an important tool for wide-field imaging and quantification of various lab-on-a-chip assays developed for global health applications{,} such as monitoring of HIV+ patients for CD4 counts or viral load measurements.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Programmable colored illumination microscopy (PCIM) has been proposed as a flexible optical staining technique for microscopic contrast enhancement. In this method, we replace the condenser diaphragm of a conventional microscope with a programmable thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD). By displaying different patterns on the LCD, numerous established imaging modalities can be realized, such as bright field, dark field, phase contrast, oblique illumination, and Rheinberg illuminations, which conventionally rely on intricate alterations in the respective microscope setups. Furthermore, the ease of modulating both the color and the intensity distribution at the aperture of the condenser opens the possibility to combine multiple microscopic techniques, or even realize completely new methods for optical color contrast staining, such as iridescent dark-field and iridescent phase-contrast imaging. The versatility and effectiveness of \{PCIM\} is demonstrated by imaging of several transparent colorless specimens, such as unstained lung cancer cells, diatom, textile fibers, and a cryosection of mouse kidney. Finally, the potentialities of \{PCIM\} for RGB-splitting imaging with stained samples are also explored by imaging stained red blood cells and a histological section. },
